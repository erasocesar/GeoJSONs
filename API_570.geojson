Process piping systems that are temporarily out of service or idled but have been \nmothballed (preserved for potential future use) are still covered by this code. \n1.1.2 Intent \nThe intent of this code is to specify the in-service inspection and condition-monitoring program, as well as \nrepair guidance that is needed to determine and maintain the ongoing integrity of piping systems. That \nprogram should provide reasonably accurate and timely assessments to determine if any changes in the \ncondition of piping could possibly compromise continued safe operation.

See definition of ‚Äúauthorized inspection \nagency ‚Äù in 3.1.6. \n4.2 Authorized Piping Inspector Qualification and Certification \nAuthorized piping inspectors shall have education and experience in accordance with Annex A of this \ninspection code. Authorized piping inspectors shall be certified in accordance with the provisions of Annex A. \nWhenever the term ‚Äúinspector ‚Äù is used in this code, it refers to an ‚Äúauthorized piping inspector. ‚Äù \n4.3 Responsibilities \n4.3.1 Owner-Operator Organization \n4.3.1.1 Systems and Procedures \nAn owner-operator organization is responsible for developing, documenting, implementing, executing, and \nassessing piping inspection systems and inspection procedures that will meet the requirements of this \ninspection code. These systems and procedures will be contained in a quality assurance inspection/repair \nmanagement system and shall include the following: \na)organization and reporting structure for inspection personnel;\nb)documenting and maintaining inspection and quality control procedures;\nc)documenting and reporting inspection and test results;\nd)developing and documenting inspection plans;\ne)developing and documenting risk-based assessments;\nf)developing and documenting the appropriate inspection intervals;\ng)corrective action for inspection and test results;\nh)internal auditing for compliance with the quality assurance inspection manual;\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris)review and approval of drawings, design calculations, and specifications for repairs, alterations,\nreratings, and Fitness-For-Service assessments;\nj)ensuring that all jurisdictional requirements for piping inspection, repairs, alterations, and rerating ar eontinuously met;\nk)reporting to the authorized piping inspector any process changes that could affect piping integrity;\nl)training requirements for inspection personnel regarding inspection tools, techniques, and technicalknowledge base;\nm)controls necessary so that only qualified welders and procedures are used for all repairs and alterations;\nn)controls necessary so that only qualified NDE personnel and procedures are utilized;\no)controls necessary so that only materials conforming to the applicable construction code are utilizedf\nor repairs and alterations;\np) controls necessary so that all inspection measurement and test equipment are properly maintained andcalibrated;\nq)controls necessary so that the work of contract inspection or repair organizations meet the sameinspection requirements as the owner-operator organization and this inspection code;\nr)internal auditing requirements for the quality control system for PRDs;\ns)requirement s and work process to increase the confidence that inspectors have an annual vision testand are capable of reading standard J-1 letters on standard Jaeger test type charts for near vision;\nt)controls necessary to prevent external covering or insulation of cold wall piping or headers that mightcause overheating and rupture;\nu)controls necessary to ensure that temporary facilities are managed and removed at the appropriatetimes.\n4.3.1.2 Inspection Organization Audits \nEach owner-operator organization shall be audited periodically to determine if they are meeting the \nrequirements of an authorized inspection agency as defined in this inspection code. The audit team should \nconsist of people experienced and competent in the application of this code. The audit team should typically be from another owner-operator plant site, company central office, or from a third-party organization \nexperienced and competent in refining and/or petrochemical process plant inspection programs or a \ncombination of third-party and other owner-operator sites. \nThe following key elements of an inspection program should be assessed by the audit team: \na)the requirements and principles of this inspection code are being met;\nb) owner-operator responsibilities are being properly executed;\nc)documented inspection plans are in place for covered piping systems;\nd)intervals and extent of inspections are adequate for covered piping systems;\ne)general types of inspections and surveillance are being adequately applied;\nf)inspection data analysis, evaluation, and recording are adequate;\ng) repairs, reratings, and alterations comply with this code.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nThe owner-operator shall receive a report of the audit team ‚Äôs scope and findings. After review of the report, \nnon-conformances should be prioritized, and corrective actions implemented. Other suggestions for \nimprovement are at the discretion of the owner-operator. Each organization should establish a system for \ntracking and completion of audit findings. This information should also be reviewed during subsequent \naudits. \n4.3.1.3 MOC \nThe owner-operator is also responsible for implementing an effective MOC process that will review and \ncontrol changes to the process and assets (e.g. piping and piping components). An effective MOC process \nis vital to the success of any piping integrity management program so the inspection group can: \na)address issues concerning the adequacy of the piping design and current condition of the propos edhanges;\nb)anticipate changes in corrosion or other types of damage and their effects on the adequacy on th epressure piping and update the inspection plan and records to account for those changes.\nThe MOC process shall include the appropriate materials/corrosion experience and expertise to effectively \nforecast what changes might affect piping integrity. The inspection group shall be involved in the approval \nprocess for changes that may affect piping integrity. Changes to pipe components, supports, and the \nprocess shall be included in the MOC process to ensure its effectiveness. \n4.3.1.4 IOWs \nThe owner-operator should implement and maintain an effective program for creating, establishing, and \nmonitoring IOWs. IOWs are implemented to avoid process parameter exceedances that may have an \nunanticipated impact on pressure equipment integrity. Future inspection plans and intervals have \nhistorically been based on prior measured corrosion rates resulting from past op erating conditions. Without \nan effective IOW and process control program, there often is no warning of changing operating conditions \nthat could affect the integrity of equipment or validation of the current inspection plan. Deviations from and \nchanges of trends within established IOW limits should be brought to the attention of inspection/engineering personnel so they may modify or create new inspection plans depending upon the seriousness of the \nexceedance. \nIOWs should be established for process parameters (both physical and chemical) that could impact equipment integrity if not properly controlled. Examples of the process parameters include temperatures, \npressures, fluid velocities, pH, flow rates, chemical or water injection rates, levels of corrosive constituents, \nchemical composition, etc. IOWs for key process parameters may have both upper and lower limits \nestablished, as needed. Particular attention to monitoring IOWs should also be provided during start-ups, \nshutdowns, and significant process upsets. See API 584 for more information on issues that may assist in \nthe development of an IOW program. \n4.3.1.5 Pressure Equipment Integrity Incident Investigations \nThe owner-operator should investigate pressure equipment integrity incidents and near-misses (near-leaks) \nto determine causes (root, contributing, and direct), which may result in updates to the associated \ninspection program, IOW, Corrosion Control Document, etc. If pressure equipment integrity incidents and \nnear-misses are recognized and investigated, and the causes are identified, then future leaks and failures \nof pressure equipment can be minimized or prevented. API 585 covers pressure equipment integrit y \nincident investigations and provides owner-operator with guidelines for developing, implementing, \nsustaining, and enhancing an investigation program for pressure equipment integrity incidents. \n4.3.1.6 Corrosion Control Document \nThe owner-operator should assess piping systems, as identified in the owner-operator‚Äôs piping inspection \nprograms, for credible damage mechanisms. API 970 provides guidance to address this and may be used. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nThe Corrosion Control Document s or alternate document identifying all credible damage mechanisms \nshould be available to all stakeholders (e.g. inspector, mechanical integrity engineering, and process \nengineers) who have a role in fixed equipment integrity. \n4.3.2 Repair Organization \nThe repair organization is responsible to the owner-operator and shall provide the materials, equipment, \nquality control, and workmanship necessary to maintain and repair the piping or PRD in accordance with \nthe requirements of this inspection code. The repair organization shall meet one of the following criteria: \na)the holder of a valid ASME Certificate of Authorization that authorizes the use of an appropriate ASMEcode symbol stamp;\nb)the holder of another recognized code of construction certificate that authorizes the use of anappropriate construction code symbol stamp;\nc)the holder of a valid R-stamp issued by the National Board for repair of pressure vessels;\nd)the holder of a valid VR-stamp issued by the National Board for repair and servicing of relief valves;\ne)an owner-operator of pressure piping and/or relief valves who repairs their own equipment i naccordance with this code;\nf)a repair contractor whose qualifications are acceptable to the pressure piping owner-operator;\ng)an individual or organization authorized by the legal jurisdiction to repair pressure piping or servicePRD s.\n4.3.3 Personnel \n4.3.3.1 Piping Engineer \nThe piping engineer is responsible to the owner-operator for activities involving design, engineering review, \n4.3.3.2 Authorized Piping Inspector \nWhen inspections, repairs, or alterations are being conducted on piping systems, the designated authorized \npiping inspector shall be responsible to the owner-operator for: \nare met;\nb) being directly involved in the inspection activities, which in most cases will require field activities toensure that procedures are followed;\nc)extending the scope of the inspection (with appropriate consultation with engineers/specialists), wherejustified depending upon the findings of the inspection;\nd)notifying the owner-operator in a timely manner and making appropriate repair or other mitigativerecommendations, where non-conformances are discovered.\nThe inspector shall be knowledgeable with piping system damage mechanisms listed in API 571, as well \nas the content of API 574, API 576, API 577, API 578, API 583, API 584, API 585, and API 588, and be \nknowledgeable in API 580 where RBI is in use, where these are applicable or in use by the owner-operator. \nThe inspector shall be able to use the guidance contained in these documents to meet the requirements \nand/or expectations in this code. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nThe authorized piping inspector may be assisted in performing visual inspections by other properly trained \nand qualified individuals, who may or may not be certified piping inspectors ( e.g. examiners and operating \npersonnel). Personnel performing NDE shall meet the qualifications identified in 4.3.3.3 but need not be \nauthorized piping inspectors. However, all examination results shall be evaluated and accepted by the \nauthorized piping inspector. See 3.1. 7 for the definition of ‚Äúauthorized piping inspector. ‚Äù \n4.3.3.3 Examiners \nThe examiner shall perform the specified NDE in accordance with job requirements. See 3.1.29 for the \ndefinition of ‚Äúexaminer. ‚Äù \nThe examiner is not required to be certified in accordance with Annex A and does not need to be an \nemployee of the owner-operator. The examiner shall be trained and competent in the NDE procedures \nbeing used and hold industry or owner-operator certifications in those procedures. Examples of other \ncertifications that may be required include ASNT SNT-TC-1A, ASNT CP-189, AWS CWI, API QUTE/QUSE, \nASNT ISQ, and CGSB. Inspectors conducting their own examinations with NDE techniques shall also be \nappropriately qualified in accordance with owner-operator requirements and appropriate industry \nstandards. \nThe examiner ‚Äôs employer shall maintain certification records of the examiners employed, including dates \nand results of personnel qualifications. These records shall be available to the inspector. \n4.3.3.4 Inspection Supervisor \nThe owner-o perator shall designate a role or position responsible for leading the mechanical integrity \nprograms established under this code. The individual assigned to the role/position will ensure compliance \nand advise facility management on compliance with and non-conformance with any of the component \nactivities required by this code. The job title may be variable and would be interchangeable with titles such \nas chief inspector and inspection authority. \n4.3.3.5 Others \nOperating, maintenance, engineering (process and mechanical), or other personnel who have special \nknowledge or expertise related to piping systems shall be responsible for timely notification to the inspector \nand/or engineer of issues that may affect piping integrity, such as the following: \na)any action that requires MOC or inspection activity because of an MOC;\nb)operations outside defined IOWs;\nc)changes in source of feedstock and other process fluids that could increase process-related corrosionrates or introduce new damage mechanisms;\nd) piping failures, repair actions conducted, and failure analysis reports;\ne)cleaning and decontamination methods used or other maintenance procedures that could affect pipingand equipment integrity;\nf)reports from other plants ‚Äô experiences that have come to their attention regarding similar service pipin gand associated equipment failures;\ng)any unusual conditions that may develop (e.g. noises, leaks, vibration, movement, insulation damage,\nexternal piping deterioration, support structure deterioration, and significant bolting corrosion);\nh)any engineering evaluation, including Fitness-For-Service assessments, that might require current orfuture actions to maintain mechanical integrity until next inspection.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris",

These systems and procedures will be contained in a quality assurance inspection/repair \nmanagement system and shall include the following: \na)organization and reporting structure for inspection personnel;\nb)documenting and maintaining inspection and quality control procedures;\nc)documenting and reporting inspection and test results;\nd)developing and documenting inspection plans;\ne)developing and documenting risk-based assessments;\nf)developing and documenting the appropriate inspection intervals;\ng)corrective action for inspection and test results;\nh)internal auditing for compliance with the quality assurance inspection manual;\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris)review and approval of drawings, design calculations, and specifications for repairs, alterations,\nreratings, and Fitness-For-Service assessments;\nj)ensuring that all jurisdictional requirements for piping inspection, repairs, alterations, and rerating ar eontinuously met;\nk)reporting to the authorized piping inspector any process changes that could affect piping integrity;\nl)training requirements for inspection personnel regarding inspection tools, techniques, and technicalknowledge base;\nm)controls necessary so that only qualified welders and procedures are used for all repairs and alterations;\nn)controls necessary so that only qualified NDE personnel and procedures are utilized;\no)controls necessary so that only materials conforming to the applicable construction code are utilizedf\nor repairs and alterations;\np) controls necessary so that all inspection measurement and test equipment are properly maintained andcalibrated;\nq)controls necessary so that the work of contract inspection or repair organizations meet the sameinspection requirements as the owner-operator organization and this inspection code;\nr)internal auditing requirements for the quality control system for PRDs;\ns)requirement s and work process to increase the confidence that inspectors have an annual vision testand are capable of reading standard J-1 letters on standard Jaeger test type charts for near vision;\nt)controls necessary to prevent external covering or insulation of cold wall piping or headers that mightcause overheating and rupture;\nu)controls necessary to ensure that temporary facilities are managed and removed at the appropriatetimes.\n4.3.1.2 Inspection Organization Audits \nEach owner-operator organization shall be audited periodically to determine if they are meeting the \nrequirements of an authorized inspection agency as defined in this inspection code. The audit team should \nconsist of people experienced and competent in the application of this code. The audit team should typically be from another owner-operator plant site, company central office, or from a third-party organization \nexperienced and competent in refining and/or petrochemical process plant inspection programs or a \ncombination of third-party and other owner-operator sites. \nThe following key elements of an inspection program should be assessed by the audit team: \na)the requirements and principles of this inspection code are being met;\nb) owner-operator responsibilities are being properly executed;\nc)documented inspection plans are in place for covered piping systems;\nd)intervals and extent of inspections are adequate for covered piping systems;\ne)general types of inspections and surveillance are being adequately applied;\nf)inspection data analysis, evaluation, and recording are adequate;\ng) repairs, reratings, and alterations comply with this code.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nThe owner-operator shall receive a report of the audit team ‚Äôs scope and findings. After review of the report, \nnon-conformances should be prioritized, and corrective actions implemented. Other suggestions for \nimprovement are at the discretion of the owner-operator. Each organization should establish a system for \ntracking and completion of audit findings. This information should also be reviewed during subsequent \naudits. \n4.3.1.3 MOC \nThe owner-operator is also responsible for implementing an effective MOC process that will review and \ncontrol changes to the process and assets (e.g. piping and piping components). An effective MOC process \nis vital to the success of any piping integrity management program so the inspection group can: \na)address issues concerning the adequacy of the piping design and current condition of the propos edhanges;\nb)anticipate changes in corrosion or other types of damage and their effects on the adequacy on th epressure piping and update the inspection plan and records to account for those changes.\nThe MOC process shall include the appropriate materials/corrosion experience and expertise to effectively \nforecast what changes might affect piping integrity. The inspection group shall be involved in the approval \nprocess for changes that may affect piping integrity. Changes to pipe components, supports, and the \nprocess shall be included in the MOC process to ensure its effectiveness. \n4.3.1.4 IOWs \nThe owner-operator should implement and maintain an effective program for creating, establishing, and \nmonitoring IOWs. IOWs are implemented to avoid process parameter exceedances that may have an \nunanticipated impact on pressure equipment integrity. Future inspection plans and intervals have \nhistorically been based on prior measured corrosion rates resulting from past op erating conditions. Without \nan effective IOW and process control program, there often is no warning of changing operating conditions \nthat could affect the integrity of equipment or validation of the current inspection plan. Deviations from and \nchanges of trends within established IOW limits should be brought to the attention of inspection/engineering personnel so they may modify or create new inspection plans depending upon the seriousness of the \nexceedance. \nIOWs should be established for process parameters (both physical and chemical) that could impact equipment integrity if not properly controlled. Examples of the process parameters include temperatures, \npressures, fluid velocities, pH, flow rates, chemical or water injection rates, levels of corrosive constituents, \nchemical composition, etc. IOWs for key process parameters may have both upper and lower limits \nestablished, as needed. Particular attention to monitoring IOWs should also be provided during start-ups, \nshutdowns, and significant process upsets. See API 584 for more information on issues that may assist in \nthe development of an IOW program. \n4.3.1.5 Pressure Equipment Integrity Incident Investigations \nThe owner-operator should investigate pressure equipment integrity incidents and near-misses (near-leaks) \nto determine causes (root, contributing, and direct), which may result in updates to the associated \ninspection program, IOW, Corrosion Control Document, etc. If pressure equipment integrity inciden\nSin√≥nimos ES: organizaci√≥n de inspecci√≥n; propietario-operador; inspector autorizado; responsabilidades\nSynonyms EN: Owner Operator Inspection Organization; owner-operator inspection organization api 570"

Piping systems (sometimes referred to as corrosion \nsystems or loops) are a collection of piping circuits usually related to a common process intent/function and \nare typically defined at a process flow diagram level. Piping circuits are often defined at the process and \ninstrumentation diagram (P&ID) level. Potential damage mechanisms are primarily a function of the \nprocess/operating conditions, the material of construction, and mechanical design. Defining systems and \ncircuits based upon potential damage mechanisms is the first step in creating an effective inspection plan. \nSystemization is the first cut for defining the potential corrosion issues, and is a convenient reference to the \ngeneral location of damage mechanisms within the process unit. Piping systems generally have common \ncharacteristics, such as one or more of the following: \na)process intent (e.g. overhead reflux system);\nb)process control scheme ( e.g. temperature/end point);\nc)process stream composition;\nd) design operating conditions;\ne)similar or related set of IOWs.\nPiping systems may contain (or pass through) one or more equipment items ( e.g. exchangers and pumps) \nand will typically contain one or multiple piping circuits. Piping systems and circuits developed from \nexpected/identified damage mechanisms enable the development of concise inspection plans and form the \nbasis for improved data analysis. Piping circuitization is a further breakdown of piping systems into sections \nof piping and/or individual pipe components, which have common damage mechanisms and same material \nof construction and have similar damage rates and modes. \nRefer to API 574 for more information o n development of piping systems and circuits. \n5.1.2 Development of an Inspection Plan \nAn inspection plan shall be established for all piping systems and/or circuits and associated PRDs within \nthe scope of this code. The inspection plan shall be developed by the inspector and/or engineer. \nA corrosion specialist shall be consulted to identify susceptibilities to credible damage mechanisms and \npotential locations. Some examples include the following: \na)localized corrosion;\nb)cracking;\nc)CUF;\nd)metallurgical damage;\ne)piping systems that operate at elevated temperatures [above 750 ¬∞F (400 ¬∞C)];\nf)piping systems that operate below the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature.\nSpecial attention in the inspection plan should be given to any types of deterioration or issues listed in 5.4.2. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nThe inspection plan is developed from the analysis of several sources of data, including the piping \ninspection records. Piping systems shall be evaluated based on present or possible types of damage \nmechanisms. The method and extent of the NDE technique shall be based off of the ability for it to detect \nthe damage mechanism. Subdividing piping systems into circuits subject to common damage mechanisms \nfacilitates the development of an inspection strategy and plan and selecting the inspection techniques best \nsuited to find the damage that is most likely to occur in the piping circuit. Examinations shall be scheduled \nat intervals that consider the following: \na) damage mechanisms (see API 571);\nb)rate of damage progression;\nc)tolerance of the equipment to the type of damage;\nd)capability of the NDE method to identify the damage;\ne)maximum intervals as defined in codes and standards;\nf)extent of examination;\ng)recent operating history, including IOW exceedances;\nh)MOC records that may impact inspection plans;\ni)RBI assessments or piping classification.\nThe inspection plan should be developed using the most appropriate sources of information, including those \nreferences listed in Section 2. Inspection plans shall be reviewed and amended as needed when variables \nare identified that could impact damage mechanisms and/or deterioration rates (as defined by the owner-operator). See API 574 for more information on the development of inspection plans. \nThe inspection plan shall contain the inspection tasks and schedule required to monitor identified damage \nmechanisms and ensure the mechanical integrity of the piping systems. The plan should: \na)define the type(s) of inspection needed ( e.g. internal, external, on-stream, and nonintrusive);\nb)identify the next inspection date for each inspection type;\nc)describe the inspection methods and NDE techniques;\nd)describe the extent and locations of inspection and NDE at CMLs;\ne)describe the surface cleaning requirements needed for inspection and examinations for each type ofinspection;\nf)describe the requirements of any needed pressure test ( e.g. type of test, test pressure, test temperature,\nand duration);\ng)describe any required repairs if known or previously planned before the upcoming inspection;\nh)describe the types of damage anticipated or experienced in the piping systems;\ni)define the location of the expected damage;\nj)define any special access and preparation needed.\nGeneric inspection plans based on industry standards and practices may be used as a starting point in \ndeveloping specific equipment inspection plans. The inspection plan may or may not exist in a single \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n5.2 RBI \n5.2.1 General \nAn RBI evaluation may be used to determine inspection intervals or due dates and the type and extent of \nfuture inspection/examinations. An RBI assessment determines risk by combining the probability and the \nconsequence of piping system failure. When an owner-operator chooses to conduct an RBI assessment, it \nshall include the minimum program requirements as established by API 580. API 581 provides a set of \nsemi-quantitative methodologies for assessing risk (both probability of failure and consequence of fail ure) \nand for developing inspection plans that are consistent with key elements defined in API 580. \nKey steps evaluat e both the probability and consequence of a failure. I dentifying and evaluating credible \ndamage mechanisms, current piping condition, and the effectiveness of the past inspections are important \nsteps in assessing the probability of piping failure. Identifying and evaluating the process fluid(s), potential \ninjuries, environmental damage, piping system damage, and piping system downtime are important steps \nin assessing the consequence of piping failure. Identifying and implementing IOWs for key process \nvariables is an important adjunct to RBI (see 4.3.1.4), as well as any other method of planning and \nscheduling inspections. \n5.2.2 Documentation \nIt is essential that all RBI assessments be thoroughly documented in accordance with the requirements in \nAPI 580 clearly defining all the factors contributing to both the probability and consequence of a failure of \nthe equipment. \nAfter an RBI assessment is conducted, the results can be used to establish the equipment inspection plan and better\n define the following: \na)the most appropriate inspection and NDE methods, tools, and techniques;\nb)the extent of NDE ( e.g. percentage of equipment to examine);\nc)the interval or due date for internal (where applicable), external, and on-stream inspections;\nd)the need for pressure testing after damage has occurred or after repairs/alterations have beencompleted;\ne) the prevention or mitigation steps to reduce the probability or consequence of equipment failure when\nnecessary to reduce risk to an acceptable level (e.g. repairs, process changes, and inhibitors).\n5.2.3 Frequency of RBI Assessments \nWhen RBI assessments are used to set equipment inspection intervals or due dates, the assessment shall \nbe updated after each equipment inspection as defined in API 580. The RBI assessment shall be updated \neach time process or piping component /support changes are made that could significantly affect damage \nrates or damage mechanisms and anytime an unanticipated failure or inspection discovery occurs. The RBI \nassessment shall be reviewed, updated as necessary, and approved by the engineer and inspector at \nintervals not to exceed 10 y ears. \n5.3 Preparation for Inspection \n5.3.1 General \nSafety precautions shall be included when preparing piping systems for inspection and maintenance \nactivities to eliminate exposure to hazardous fluids, energy sources, and physical hazards. Regulations \ngovern many aspects of piping systems inspection and shall be followed where applicable. See API 574 for \nmore information on the safety aspects of piping inspection. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nProcedures for segregating piping systems, installing blinds (blanks), and testing tightness should be an \nintegral part of safety practices for flanged connections. Appropriate safety precautions shall be taken before \nany piping system is opened. In general, the section of piping to be opened should be isolated from all sources \nof harmful liquids, gases, or vapors and purged to remove all oil and toxic or flammable gases and vapors. \nSee API 574 for more information on the equipment preparation and entry aspects of piping inspection. \n5.3.2 Records Review \nBefore performing any of the required inspections, inspectors shall familiarize themselves with prior history \nof the piping system for which they are responsible. They should review the piping system ‚Äôs prior inspection \nresults, prior repairs, current inspection plan, and/or other similar service inspections. Additionally, it is \nadvisable to ascertain recent operating history that may affect the inspection plan. The types of damage \nand failure modes experienced by piping systems are provided in API 571 and A PI 579-1/ASME FFS-1. \n5.4 Inspection for Types and Locations of Damage Modes of Deterioration and Failure \n5.4.1 Piping System Damage Types \nThe presence or potential of damage in piping systems is dependent upon its material of construction, \ndesign, construction, and operating conditions. The inspector should be familiar with these items and with \nthe causes and characteristics of potential flaws and damage mechanisms associated with the equipment \nbeing inspected. \nInformation concerning common damage mechanisms (critical factors, appearance, and typical inspection \nand monitoring techniques) is found in API 571 and other sources of information on damage mechanisms \nincluded in the Bibliography. Additional recommended inspection practices for specific types of damage \nmechanisms are described in API 574. API 571 describes common damage mechanisms and inspection \ntechniques to identify them. \n5.4.2 Areas of Deterioration for Piping Systems \nEach owner-operator shall provide specific attention to the need for inspection of piping systems that are \nsusceptible to the following credible types and areas of deterioration: \na)injection points and mixing points;\nb) deadlegs;\nc)CUI, including ECSCC inspection;\nd)soil-to-air interfaces (SAIs) and soil corrosion of buried piping;\ne)service specific and localized corrosion;\nf)erosion and corrosion/erosion;\ng)environmental cracking;\nh)corrosion beneath linings and deposits;\ni)fatigue cracking;\nj)creep cracking;\nk)freeze damage;\nl)contact point corrosion.\nNOTE For different reasons, brittle fracture and fatigue are not normally proactively managed or mitigated by \ninspection activities. The owner-operators should be aware of the potential for brittle fracture or fatigue and manage \nthe risk appropriately ( e.g. changing the mechanical design, or operation, adding process controls, etc.). \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nRefer to API 571 and AP I 574 for more detailed information about the above-noted types and areas of \ndeterioration. \n5.5 General Types of Inspection and Surveillance \n5.5.1 General \nDifferent types of inspection and surveillance are appropriate depending on the circumstances and the \npiping system. These include the following types of inspections and inspection focus areas that are covered \nin more detail in the following subsections: \na)Internal Visual Inspection;\nb) On-s tream Inspection;\nc)Thickness Measurement Inspection and Various NDE E xaminations;\nd)External Visual Inspection;\ne)Vibrating Piping and Line Movement Surveillance;\nf)Supplemental Inspection.\nInspections shall be conducted in accordance with the inspection plan for each piping circuit or system. Refer to\n Section 6 for the interval/frequency and extent of inspection. Corrosion and other damage identified \nduring inspections and examinations shall be characterized, sized, and evaluated per Section 7. Revisions \nto the inspection plan shall be approved by the inspector and/or piping engineer. \n5.5.2 Internal Visual Inspection \nInternal visual inspections are not normally performed on piping. When it is practical, internal visual \ninspections may be scheduled for systems such as large-diameter transfer lines, ducts, catalyst lines, or \nother large-diameter piping systems. Such inspections are similar in nature to pressure vessel inspections \nand should be conducted with methods and procedures such as those outlined in API 510 and API 572. \nRemote visual inspection techniques can be helpful when inspecting piping, which is too small to enter. \nAn additional opportunity for internal inspection is provided when piping flanges are disconnected, allowing \nvisual inspection of internal surfaces with or without the use of NDE. When piping flanges are disconnected, \nthe gasket surface, studs, and nuts should be examined for any signs of deterioration. Removing a section \nof piping and splitting it along its centerline also permits access to internal surfaces where there is need for \nsuch inspection. \n5.5.3 On-stream Inspection \nThe on-stream inspection may be required by the inspection plan. All on-stream inspections should be \nconducted by either an inspector or examiner. All on-stream inspection work performed by an examiner \nshall be authorized and approved by the inspector. When on-stream inspections of the pressure boundary \nare specified, they shall be designed to detect the damage mechanisms identified in the inspection plan. \nThe inspection may include several NDE techniques to check for various types of damage that pertain to \nthe circuit as identified during inspection planning. Techniques used in on-stream inspections are chosen \nfor their ability to identify specific damage mechanisms from the exterior and their capabilities to perform at \nthe on-stream conditions of the piping system ( e.g. metal temperatures). The external thickness \nmeasurement inspection described in 5.6.3 may be a part of an on-stream inspection. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nThere are inherent limitations when applying external NDE techniques trying to locate damage on the inside \nof piping components. Issues that can affect those limitations include the following: \na)type of material of construction (alloy);\nb) weldments;\nc)pipe junctions, nozzles, support saddles, and reinforcing plates;\nd)internal lining or cladding;\ne)physical access and equipment temperature;\nf)limitations inherent to the selected NDE technique to detect the damage mechanism;\ng)type of damage mechanism (e.g. pitting versus general wall thinning).\nAPI 574 provides more information on piping system inspection and should be applied when performing \non-stream inspections. \n5.5.4 Thickness Measurement Inspection and Various NDE Examinations \nThickness measurements are obtained to verify the thickness of piping components. Thes e data are used \nto calculate the corrosion rates and remaining life of the piping system. Thickness measurements shall be \nobtained by the inspector or the examiner at the direction of the inspector. The owner-operator shall ensure \nthat all individuals conducting thickness measurements are trained and qualified in accordance with the \napplicable procedure used during the examination. \nTypically, point thickness measurements are utilized to determine and track corrosion rates for damage \nmechanisms that produce uniform corrosion, whereas profile RT (if line size allows), UT scanning, or grids \nshould be used where localized corrosion is expected/predicted. \nScreening examination techniques [ e.g. guided wave examination, electromagnetic acoustic transducer \n(EMAT), Lamb wave] are typically limited to the qualitative data results (i.e. volumetric percentage of wall \nloss, versus actual discrete thickness values). If used, screening examination techniques are considered to \nfulfill the requirements for thickness measurement inspection provided they are used complimentary to an \ninspection plan that also includes periodic quantitative examination techniques to establish actual baseline \nthickness data, or to prove up screening technique examination results conducted at appropriate intervals. \nSee API 574‚ÄîSection 10. 4, ‚ÄúThickness Measurement s,‚Äù for additional guidance in conducting ultrasonic \nthickness measurements. \n5.5.5 External Visual Inspection \nAn external visual inspection is performed to determine the condition of the outside of the piping, insulation system,\n painting, and coating systems, and associated hardware, and to check for signs of misalignment, \nvibration, and leakage (see API 574). When corrosion product buildup or other debris is noted at pipe \nsupport contact areas, it may be necessary to lift the pipe off such supports for thorough inspection. When \nlifting piping that is in operation, extra care should be exercised and consultation with an engineer may be \nnecessary. Based on the support type/configuration, screening techniques such as guided wave/EMAT or \nLamb-wave inspections can be used to locate areas of interest for follow-up inspection using more \nquantitative NDE techniques. Users should understand the limitations of each of these techniques to \nminimize the potential for missing localized corrosion. External piping inspections may be made when the \npiping system is on-stream. Refer to API 574 for information concerning conducting ext ernal inspections. \nExternal piping inspections may include CUI inspections per 5. 8. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nExternal inspections shall include surveys for the condition of piping hangers and supports. Instances of \ncracked or broken hangers, ‚Äúbottoming out‚Äù of spring supports, support shoes displaced from support \nmembers, or other improper restraint conditions shall be reported and corrected. \nVertical support dummy legs shall be checked to confirm they have not filled with water causing external \ncorrosion of the pressure piping or internal corrosion of the support leg. \nHorizontal support dummy legs also shall be checked to determine that slight displacements from horizontal \nare not causing moisture traps against the external surface of active piping components. \nWeep/drain holes should be installed at the lowest point of vertical and horizontal dummy legs and close to \nthe process pipe weld for horizontal installations. Weep/drain holes should be always open and free of debris. \nSeveral owner-operators have identified localized corrosion at the dummy leg to process pipe connection \nusing profile RT. Corrosion was found in both open-ended and capped dummy legs. \nBellows expansion joints should be inspected visually for unusual deformations, misalignment, excessive \nangular rotation, and displacements that may exceed design. In some cases where two ply bellows have \nbeen utilized, the annular space between the inner and outer bellow should be pressure tested and/or \nmonitored for leakage. Other nonstandard piping components (e.g. flex hoses) may have different \ndegradation mechanisms (see API 574). Specialist engineers or manufacturer data sources may need to \nbe consulted in developing valid inspection plans for these components. The inspector should examine the \npiping system for any field modifications or temporary repairs not previously recorded on the piping drawings and/or records. The inspector also should be alert\n to the presence of any components that may \nbe unsuitable for long-term (LT) operation, such as improper flanges, temporary repairs (clamps), \nmodifications (flexible hoses), or valves of improper specification. Threaded components and other flanged spool pieces that may be easily removed and reinstalled deserve attention because of their higher potential \nfor installation of incorrect construction materials. \nThe periodic external inspection called for in 6.4 should normally be conducted by the inspector. The \ninspector shall be\n responsible for recordkeeping and repair inspection. Qualified examiners and operating \nor maintenance personnel may also conduct external inspections, when acceptable to the inspector. In \nqualified through an appropriate amount of training acceptable to the owner-operator. \nIn addition to these scheduled external inspections that are documented in inspection records, it is beneficial for\n personnel who frequent the area to report deterioration or changes to the inspector (see API \n574 for examples of such deterioration). \nDuring the external inspection, attention should be given to weldments of attachments (e.g. reinforcement \nplates and clips) looking for cracking, corrosion, or other flaws. Any signs of leakage should be investigated \nso that the sources can be established. Normally, weep holes in reinforcing plates (re-pads) should remain \nopen to provide visual evidence of leakage. If weep holes are plugged to exclude moisture, they shall not \nbe plugged with material capable of sustaining pressure behind the reinforcing plate unless Fitness-ForService assessments and an approved MOC have demonstrated that the reinforcement plate can withstand \nthe design pressure of the piping system. \n5.5.6 Vibrating Piping and Line Movement Surveillance \nOperating personnel should report vibrating or swaying piping to engineering or inspection personnel for assessment.\n Evidence of significant line movement that could have resulted from liquid hammer ( e.g. piping \nshifted off pipe support‚Äôs normal/designed location), liquid slugging in vapor lines, abnormal thermal \nexpansion, or from other sources, such as large reciprocating compressors, should be reported. At locations \nwhere vibrating piping systems are restrained to resist dynamic pipe stresses (such as at shoes, anchors, \nguides, struts, dampeners, and hangers), periodic MT or PT should be considered to check for the onset \nof fatigue cracking. Branch connections should receive special attention, particularly unbraced SBP \nconnected to vibrating pipe. However, fatigue is generally considered to be a design-related mechanism. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nOnce a crack has been initiated, it can grow at unknown rates and inspection alone cannot be used to \nmanage the risk of failure. Typically, at the point a fatigue crack is detectible, approximately 80 % of the life \nhas been consumed and failure can occur prior to the next scheduled inspection cycle without careful \nengineering assessment/analysis. \n5.5.7 Supplemental Inspection \nOther inspections may be scheduled as appropriate or necessary. Examples of such inspections include \nperiodic use of RT and/or thermography to check for fouling or internal plugging, thermography to check for \nhot spots in refractory lined systems, additional inspections after reported process unit upsets, verifying \npreviously measured data for accuracy, inspection for environmental cracking, and any other piping-specific \ndamage mechanism. Acoustic emission, acoustic leak detection, and thermography can be used for remote \nleak detection and surveillance. Areas susceptible to localized erosion or erosion-corrosion should be \ninspected using visual inspection internally if possible or by using other inspection approaches that provide \nvisualization of the internal condition ( i.e. RT or ultrasonic mapping). Scanning of the areas with UT is also \na good technique and should be used if the line is larger than NPS 12. \n5.6 CMLs \n5.6.1 General \nCMLs are specific areas along the piping circuit where inspections are conducted. The nature of the CML \nvaries according to its location in the piping system. The allocation of CMLs shall be based on the potential \nfor service-specific damage mechanisms (e.g. localized corrosion, as described in API 574 and API 571). \nThe definitions of ‚Äúcondition monitoring location‚Äù (3.1.9) and ‚Äúexamination point ‚Äù (3.1.2 7) are often a point \nof confusion at operating sites. A CML is usually an area (e.g. an elbow or other fitting) where multiple \nmeasurements may be conducted, whereas examination points are specific spots where individual readings \nare taken. Examples of different conditions to be monitored at CMLs include wall thickness, stress cracking, \nCUI, and high temperature hydrogen attack. \n5.6.2 CML Allocation \nIn selecting, adjusting, or optimizing the number and locations of CMLs, the inspector should review the assigned credible damage mechanisms and the historical corrosion rate and patterns before making \nadjustments to the number and locations for CMLs (note that consultation from a corrosion specialist is \nadvised). While low or no corrosion of assigned CMLs may be a consideration for elimination/archiving, in \nsome cases, CMLs may have been selected to identify a problem from conditional or infrequent operati on \n(e.g. CML at a spec break downstream from an exchanger bypass, or on a lower alloy warm-up line only \nused on start-up, etc.). A decision on the type, number, and location of the CMLs should consider results \nfrom previous inspections, the patterns of corrosion and damage that are expected and the potential consequence of loss of containment. CMLs should be distributed over the piping system to provide \nadequate monitoring coverage of all types of components and fittings. Thickness measurements at CMLs \nare intended to establish general and localized corrosion rates in different sections of the piping circuits. \nCMLs may be eliminated, or the number reduced under certain circumstances when the expected damage \nmechanism will not result in a wall loss or other forms of deterioration, such as olefin plant cold side piping, \nanhydrous ammonia piping, clean noncorrosive hydrocarbon product, or high-alloy piping for product purity. \nIn circumstances where CMLs will be substantially reduced or eliminated, a corrosion specialist should be \nconsulted. \nSeveral corrosive processes common to refining and petrochemical units are relatively uniform in nature, \nresulting in a constant rate of pipe wall reduction independent of location within the piping circuit, either axially or circumferentially. Examples of such corrosion phenomena include sulfidation corrosion (if it is a \nuniform liquid phase with no naphthenic acid or high/turbulent flow rates, and the piping circuit does not \ncontain low silicon CS; see 5.12.2 and API 939-C) and hydrocarbon product lines. In these situations, the \nnumber of CMLs required to monitor a circuit will be fewer than those required to monitor circu its subject to \nmore localized metal loss. In theory, a circuit subject to perfectly uniform corrosion could be adequately \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nonitored with a single CML. Corrosion is seldom truly uniform and in fact may be quite localized, so \nadditional CMLs may be required. Where there is adequate historical thickness data for a circuit and data \nhave been validated to ensure that they are representative for the expected corrosion environment, a \nstatistical analysis may be useful to help determine the number of inspection points needed to establish the desired confidence in the calculated circuit average rate, limiting thickness, and/or remaining life. \nMore CMLs should be selected for corrosive piping systems with any of the following characteristics: \na)higher potential for creating a safety or environmental emergency in the event of a leak;\nb)higher expected or experienced corrosion rates;\nc)higher potential for localized corrosion;\nd)more complexity in terms of fittings, branches, deadlegs, injection points, and other similar items;\ne)higher potential for CUI;\nf)higher corrosion rate (or thickness) variability;\ng)higher short/long rate (or maximum/average) ratios;\nh)higher degree of process variability (process parameters that will affect localized corrosion);\ni)circuits with corrosion environments that have experienced unexpected failures in the facility orelsewhere in the industry.\nFewer CMLs can be selected for piping systems with any of the following three characteristics: \na)low potential for creating a safety or environmental emergency in the event of a leak;\nb)relatively noncorrosive piping systems (by virtue of the piping alloy or service);\nc)long, straight-run piping systems.\nCMLs can be eliminated for piping systems with any of the following characteristics:\na)extremely low potential for creating a safety or environmental emergency in the event of a leak;\nb)noncorrosive systems, as demonstrated by history or similar service;\nc)systems not subject to changes that could cause corrosion as demonstrated by history and/or periodicreviews.\nEvery CML should have at least one or more examination points identified. Examination points should be \ncarefully identified to facilitate accurate examination during follow-up inspections. Examples include the \nfollowing: \na)locations marked on uninsulated pipe using paint stencils, metal stencils, or stickers;\nb)holes cut in the insulation and plugged with covers;\nc)temporary insulation covers for fittings nozzles, etc.;\nd)isometrics or documents showing CMLs;\ne)radio frequency identification devices;\nf)computerized monitoring buttons.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nareful identification of CMLs and examination points is necessary to enhance the accuracy and \nrepeatability of the data. \nCorrosion specialists should be consulted about the appropriate placement and number of CMLs for piping \nsystems susceptible to localized corrosion or cracking, or in circumstances where CMLs will be substantially reduced or eliminated. \n5.6.3 CML Monitoring \nPiping circuits subject to higher corrosion rates or localized corrosion will normally be monitored more \nfrequently. The minimum measured thickness at a CML can be located by ultrasonic scanning or profile RT. Electromagnetic techniques also can be used to identify thin areas that may then be measured by UT \nor RT. When accomplished with UT, scanning consists of taking several thickness measurements at the \nCML searching for localized thinning. \nWhere appropriate, thickness measurements should include measurements at each of the four quadrants on pipe and fittings, with special attention to the inside and outside radius of elbows and tees where \ncorrosion/erosion could increase corrosion rates. On large pipe (typically NPT 8 and larger), four quadrants \nmay be insufficient and the number of CMLs needs to be increased or a grid scanning approach considered. \nThe thinnest reading or an average of several measurement readings taken within the area of an \nexamination point shall be recorded and used to calculate corrosion rates, remaining life, and the next \ninspection date in accordance with Section 7. When using a statistical approach for planning inspection, it \nis often desirable to record all readings taken on a CML. The rate of corrosion/damage shall be determined \nfrom successive measurements and the next inspection interval appropriately established. Corrosion rates, \nthe remaining life, and next inspection intervals should be calculated to determine the limiting component \nof each piping circuit. For systemized/circuitized piping, the corrosion rates and remaining life may be \ndetermined statistically per 6.5.3. \nCMLs should be established for areas with continuing CUI, corrosion at SAIs, immediately upstream and downstream of piping material changes (e.g. specification breaks), or other locations of potential localized \ncorrosion, as well as for general, uniform corrosion. \nCMLs should be marked on inspection or inspection isometric drawings (ISOs). The piping system may \nalso be marked to allow repetitive measurements at the same locations. This recording procedure provides \ndata for more accurate corrosion rate determination. The rate of corrosion/damage shall be determined \nfrom successive measuremen ts and the next inspection interval appropriately established based on the \nremaining life or RBI analysis. \n5.7 Condition Monitoring Methods \n5.7.1 UT \nASME BPVC, Section V, Article 23, and Section SE-797 provide guidance for performing ultrasonic \nthickness measurements. \nUltrasonic thickness measurements taken on SBP may require specialized equipment (e.g. miniature \ntransducers and/or curved shoes, as well as diameter-specific calibration blocks). \nWhen ultrasonic measurements are taken above 150 ¬∞F (65 ¬∞C), instruments, couplants, and procedures \nshould be used that will result in accurate measurements at the higher temperatures. If the procedure does \nnot compensate for higher temperatures, measurements should be adjusted by the appropriate \ntemperature correction factor. \nInspectors should be aware of possible sources of measurement inaccuracies and make every effort to eliminate their\n occurrence. All NDE techniques will have practical limits with respect to accuracy. Factors \nthat can contribute to reduced accuracy of ultrasonic measurements include the following: \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\na)improper instrument calibration;\nb)external coatings or scale;\nc)significant surface roughness;\nd)transducer placement and orientation (e.g. curved surface placement, pitch/catch probe orientation);\ne)subsurface material flaws, such as laminations;\nf)temperature effects [at temperatures above 150 ¬∞F (65 ¬∞C)];\ng)improper resolution on the detector screens;\nh)thicknesses of less than 1/8 in. (3.2 mm) for typical digital thickness gauges;\ni)improper coupling of probe to the surface (too much or too little couplant);\nj)piping diameter.\nIn addition, corrosion patterns can be nonuniform. For corrosion rate determinations to be valid, it is important \nthat measurements on the thinnest point be repeated as closely as possible to the same location. Alternatively, \nthe minimum reading or an average of several readings at an examination point may be considered. \nFollowing ultrasonic readings at CMLs, proper repair of insulation and insulation weather coating is \nrecommended to reduce the potential for CUI (see API 583 for details on insulation repair). \n5.7.2 RT \nRT profile techniques are preferred for pipe diameters of NPS 1 and smaller. P rofile RT is preferred for SBP \nwhere digital ultrasonic thickness gauging is not very reliable. P rofile RT is very often the technique of \nchoice on NPS 8 and under when localized corrosion is suspected. \nRT profile techniques may be used for measuring thicknesses, particularly in insulated systems or where \nnonuniform or localized corrosion is suspected. However, the profile measurements may only be \nquantitative within error bounds along the tangent. The extent and magnitude of these error bounds may \nbe equipment and technique specific so should be determined or documented as part of the inspection \nand/or NDE procedure. \nLocalized corrosion may vary around the pipe circumference and locating the thinnest location may require multiple profile orientation exposures or complimentary techniques ( e.g. ultrasonic examination). Where \npractical, UT can\n then be used to obtain the actual thickness of the areas to be recorded. \nRT profile techniques, which do not require removing insulation, are widely employed for detection and \npossible sizing of CUI. \nSee API 574 for additional information on thickness monitoring methods for piping. When corrosion in a \npiping system is nonuniform or the remaining thickness is approaching the required thickness, additional \nthickness measuring may be required. RT and ultrasonic scanning are the preferred methods in such cases. \n5.7.3 Other Thickness Measurement Techniques \nWhen piping systems are out of service, thickness measurements may be taken through openings using \ncalipers. Calipers are useful in determining approximate thicknesses of castings, forgings, and valve bodies, \nas well as pit depth approximations from CUI on pipe. \nPit depth measuring devices, including lasers and structured white light scanners, also may be used to \ndetermine the depth of localized metal loss. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n5.7.4 Other NDE Techniques for Piping Systems \nIn addition to thickness monitoring, other examination techniques may be appropriate to identify or monitor \nfor other specific types of damage mechanisms. In selecting the technique(s) to use during piping \ninspection, the possible types of damage for each piping circuit should be taken into consideration. The \ninspector should consult with a corrosion specialist or an engineer to help define the type of damage, the \nNDE technique, and extent of examination. API 571 and API 577 also contain some general guidance on \ninspection techniques that are appropriate for different damage mechanisms. Examples of NDE techniques \nthat may be of use include the following: \na)MT for cracks and other linear discontinuities that extend to the surface of the material in ferromagneticmaterials; ASME BPVC, Section V, Article 7, provides guidance on performing MT;\nb)PT for disclosing cracks, porosity, or pin holes that extend to the surface of the material and for outlini ngother surface imperfections, especially in nonmagnetic materials; ASME BPVC, Section V, Article 6,\nprovides guidance on performing PT;\nc)RT for detecting internal imperfections such as porosity, weld slag inclusions, cracks, and thickness ofcomponents; ASME BPVC, Section V, Article 2, provides guidance on performing RT;\nd)Ultrasonic flaw detection for detecting internal and surface breaking cracks and other elongate dscontinuities; ASME BPVC, Section V, Article 4, Article 5, and Article 23, provide guidance onperforming UT;\ne)alternating current flux leakage examination technique for detecting surface-breaking cracks andelongated discontinuities;\nf)eddy current examination for detecting localized metal loss, cracks, and elongated discontinuities;\nASME BPVC, Section V, Article 8, provides guidance on performing eddy current examination;\ng)field met allographic replication for identifying metallurgical changes;\nh)acoustic e mission examination for detecting structurally significant flaws; ASME BPVC, Section V,\nArticle 11 and Article 12, provide guidance on performing acoustic emission examination;\ni)thermography for determining temperature of components, blockages, debris /sediment levels, and flowverification;\nj)leak testing for detecting through-thickness defects; ASME BPVC, Section V, Article 10, providesguidance on performing leak testing;\nk)guided wave ex amination for the detection of changes in cross-sectional area indicative of metal loss.\n5.7.5 Surface Preparation for NDE \nAdequate surface preparation is important for proper visual examination and for the satisfactory application \nof most examination methods, such as those mentioned above. The type of surface preparation required \ndepends on the individual circumstances and NDE technique, but surface preparations, such as wire \nbrushing, blasting, chipping, grinding, or a combination of these preparations, may be required. \nAdvice from NDE specialists may be needed to select and apply the proper surface preparation for each \nindividual NDE technique. \n5.7.6 UT Angle Beam Examiners \nThe owner-operator shall specify owner-operator ‚Äìapproved or industry-qualified UT angle beam examiners \nwhen the owner-operator requires the following: \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\na)detection of interior surface [ inside diameter (ID)] breaking flaws when inspecting from the externalsurface [outside diameter (OD)]; orb)detection, characterization, and/or through-wall sizing of flaws.\nApplication examples for the use of industry-qualified UT angle beam examiners include detecting and \nsizing planer flaws from the external surface and collecting data for Fitness-For-Service evaluations. \nThe API Individual Certification Program s are one example of an industry qualified program, and API 587 \nprovide s guidance to the development of ultrasonic examiner qualification programs. \n5.8 CUI Inspection \nInspection for CUI shall be considered for externally insulated piping, including sections in intermittent \nservice or operate at temperatures between: \na) 10 ¬∞F (‚àí12 ¬∞C) and 350 ¬∞F (177 ¬∞C) for carbon and low-alloy steels;\nb) 140 ¬∞F (60 ¬∞C) and 350 ¬∞F (177 ¬∞C) for austenitic stainless steels;\nc)280 ¬∞F (138 ¬∞C) and 350 ¬∞F (177 ¬∞C) for duplex stainless steels.\nCUI inspections may be conducted as part of the external inspection. If CUI damage is found during spot \nchecks, the inspector should inspect other susceptible areas on the piping. API 583 on CUI has much more \ndetailed information on CUI and should be used in conjunction with piping CUI inspection programs. \nAlthough external insulation may appear to be in good condition, CUI damage may still be occurring. \nNonintrusive techniques, such as real-time RT, can help determine if any scale is present behind the \ninsulation without removal. Other techniques, such as profile RT, pulsed eddy current ( PEC), and guided \nwave examination can help locate damage. Removal of scale on live equipment and removal of insulation \nwhere leaks are suspected can pose a significant safety risk. CUI damage is often quite insidious in that it \ncan occur in areas where it seems unlikely. \nConsiderations for insulation removal include, but are not limited to, the following: \na)history of CUI for the specific piping system or comparable piping systems;\nb)visual condition of the external covering and insulation, rust stains, biological growth, bulged, dent edor\n punctured weather jacketing;\nc)evidence of fluid leakage ( e.g. drips or vapors);\nd)whether the systems are in intermittent service;\ne)condition/age of the external coating, if known;\nf)evidence of areas of wet insulation;\ng)potential for the type of insulation to absorb/hold more water ( e.g. open cell versus closed cellhydrophobic versus nonhydrophobic materials);\nh)low points of sagging lines;\ni)bottom of vertical pipe;\nj)proximity to equipment that could increase local humidity (e.g. cooling towers);\nk)area where temperature regimes are moving into and out of the CUI susceptible temperature range;\nl)piping components (e.g. nipples, nozzle, supports, and deadlegs) that are part of the piping system butpenetrate the insulation or can transition into the CUI range.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nReplacement of all insulation and weather jacketing removed for the purpose of CUI inspection is critical \nand shall be performed in the shortest possible timeframe following removal. Material of the same type, \nthickness, and layering shall be installed. Care shall be taken to ensure proper watershed of all-weather \njacket materials. \n5.9 Mixing Point Inspection \nMixing points are locations in piping systems where two or more different streams meet. The difference in \nstreams may be composition, temperature, or any other parameter that may contribute to deterioration, \naccelerated or localized corrosion, and/or thermal fatigue during normal or abnormal operating conditions. \nMixing points, identified by the owner-operator to have an increased susceptibility to damage, shall be \nreviewed to determine the rate of degradation from specific damage mechanisms as compared to the \nparent/contributing piping streams. Mixing points, identified as such, may be treated as separate inspection \ncircuits, and these areas may need to be inspected differently, using special techniques, different scope, \nand at more frequent intervals when compared to the inspection plan for the parent/contributing piping \nstream(s). It should be recognized that after review, some mixing points may not require any special \nemphasis inspection techniques or intervals. \nGiven the wide variation of mixing point designs and operation parameters, it is beyond the scope of this \ncode to provide specific inspection recommendations for mixing point circuits. It is anticipated that defining \nthose inspection recommendations will require careful review in consideration of mix point design \n(configuration and metallurgy), stream flow regime, composition, and temperature differences, along with \nexpected damage mechanism susceptibilities and rates of degradation. Refer to API 574 for additional \ninformation on process mixing points. \nLike injection point circuits, the preferred methods of inspecting mixing points include RT and ultrasonics \n(straight beam and/or angle beam) to determine the minimum measured thickness and/or the presence of \nother susceptible damage mechanisms (e.g. thermal fatigue cracking and pitting) at each CML. \nChanges to mixing points, including, but not limited to, changes in flow regime, stream composition or \ncharacteristics, or components of construction and their orientation, should be identified and reviewed to \ndetermine what, if any, changes to the inspection plan may be required as a result. \nSee NACE SP0114 for additional information. \n5.10 Injection Point Inspection \nInjection points can be subject to accelerated and/or localized damage from normal and abnormal operating \nconditions. Injection points, identified by the owner-operator to have an increased susceptibility to damage, \nshall be reviewed to determine the rate of degradation from specific damage mechanisms as compared to \nthe parent piping streams. Injection points, identified as such, may be treated as separate inspection circuits \n(e.g. injection point circuits), and these areas may need to be inspected differently, using special \ntechniques, different scope, and at more frequent intervals when compared to the inspection plan for the \nparent piping streams. It should be recognized that after review, some injection points may not require any \nspecial emphasis inspection techniques or intervals. \nWhen designating an injection point circuit for the purposes of inspection, the recommended upstream limit of the\n injection point circuit is a minimum of 12 in. (300 mm) or three pipe diameters upstream of the injection \npoint, whichever is greater. The recommended downstream limit of the injection point circuit is the second \nchange in flow direction past the injection point, or 25 ft (7.6 m) beyond the first change in flow direction, \nwhichever is less. In some cases, it may be more appropriate to extend this circuit to the next piece of \npressure equipment, as shown in Figure 1. \nThe selection of CMLs within injection point circuits subject to localized corrosion should be in accordance \nwith the following guidelines: \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\na)establish CMLs on appropriate fittings within the injection point circuit;\nb)establish CMLs on the pipe wall at the location of expected pipe wall impingement of injected fluid;\nc)establish CMLs at intermediate locations along the longer straight piping within the injection point circuitmay be required;\nd)establish CMLs at both the upstream and downstream limits of the injection point circuit.\nThe preferred methods of inspecting injection points are RT and/or UT scanning or closely spaced UT grid \ninspection, as appropriate, to establish the minimum measured thickness at each CML. Close grid ultrasonic\n measurements or scanning may be used, if temperatures are appropriate. \nFor some applications, it is beneficial to remove piping spools to facilitate a visual inspection of the inside surface.\n However, thickness measurements will still be required to determine the remaining thickness. \nDuring periodic scheduled inspections, more extensive inspection should be applied to an area beginning \n12 in. (300 mm) upstream of the injection nozzle and continuing for at least 10 pipe diameters downstream \nof the injection point. Additionally, measure and record the thickness at all CMLs within the injection point \ncircuit. The potential for localized corrosion can occur at the junction where the injection point enters the \nprimary pipe. The use of profile RT at the junction and UT manual scanning of the primary pipe (surrounding \nand downstream of the junction) is recommended. \nFigure 1‚Äî Typical Injection Point Piping Circuit \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nHardware used to inject the fluid into the process stream is important for proper mixing of the streams. Most \nconfigurations use either an injection nozzle or quill that project s into the process stream. These injection \nnozzles (or quills) should be periodically inspected to ensure that they are still intact and are in the correct \norientation (i.e. nozzle pointed upstream if that is the intended design). Use of RT for periodic inspections \nof the injection nozzle or quill is recommended for this purpose. \n5.11 Pressure Testing of Piping Systems \n5.11.1 General \nPressure tests are not normally conducted as part of a routine inspection (see 8.2.8 for pressure testing \nrequirements for repairs, alterations, and rerating). Exceptions to this include requirements of the Coast \nGuard for over water piping and requirements of local jurisdictions, after welded alterations, buried piping, \nor when specified by the inspector or piping engineer. When they are conducted, pressure tests shall be \nperformed in accordance with the requirements of ASME B31.3. Additional considerations for pressure \ntesting are provided in API 574, API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, and ASME PCC-2, Article 501. Service tests \nand/or lower-pressure tests, which are used only for tightness of piping systems, may be conducted at \npressures designated by the owner-operator. \nPressure tests are typically performed on an entire piping circuit. However, where practical, pressure tests of\n individual components/sections can be performed in lieu of entire circuit ( e.g. a replacement section of \npiping). An engineer should be consulted when a pressure test of piping components/sections is to be \nperformed, including use of isolation devices, to ensure that it is suitable for the intended purpose. \nWhen a pressure test is required, it shall be conducted after any heat treatment. \nBefore applying a hydrostatic test, the supporting structures and foundation design should be reviewed by \nan engineer to ensure that they are suitable for the hydrostatic load. \nNOTE The owner-operator is cautioned to avoid exceeding 90 % of the specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) for \nthe material at test temperature and especially for equipment used in elevated temperature service. \n5.11.2 Test Fluid \nThe test fluid should be water unless there is the possibility of damage due to freezing or other adverse effects of\n water on the piping system or the process ( e.g. process incompatibility with water) or unless the \ntest water will become contaminated, and its disposal will present environmental problems. In either case, \nanother suitable nontoxic liquid may be used. If the liquid is flammable, its flash point shall be at least 120 ¬∞F \n(49 ¬∞C) or greater, and consideration shall be given to the effect of the test environment on the test fluid. \nPiping fabricated of or having components of austenitic stainless steel should be hydrotested with a solution made up\n of potable water (see NOTE below), deionized/demineralized water, or steam condensate having \na total chloride concentration (not free chlorine concentration) of less than 50 ppm. \nNOTE Potable water in this context follows U.S. practice, with 250 parts per million maximum chloride, sanitized with \nchlorine or ozone. \nFor sensitized austenitic stainless steel piping subject to polythionic stress corrosion cracking, \nconsideration should be given to using an alkaline water solution for pressure testing where accelerated \ncorrosion of the sensitized region may be an issue (see NACE SP0170). \nIf a pressure test is to be maintained for a given time and the test fluid in the system is subject to thermal \nexpansion, precautions shall be taken to avoid pressure buildup beyond that specified. \nAfter testing is completed, the piping should be thoroughly drained (all high-point vents should be open \nduring draining), air blown, or otherwise dried. If potable water is not available or if immediate draining and \ndrying is not possible, water having a very low chloride level, higher pH (> 10), and inhibitor addition may \nbe considered to reduce the risk of pitting and microbiologically induced corrosion. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n5.\n11.3 Pneumatic Pressure Tests \nA pneumatic (or hydropneumatic) pressure test may be used when it is impracticable to hydrostatically test \ndue to temperature, structural, or process limitations. However, the potential risks to personnel and property \nof pneumatic testing shall be considered when carrying out such a test. As a minimum, the inspection \nprecautions contained in ASME B31.3 shall be applied in any pneumatic testing. See ASME PCC-2 for \nprecautions on pneumatic pressure testing. \n5.11.4 Test Temperature and Brittle Fracture Considerations \nAt ambient temperatures, carbon, low-alloy, and other steels, including high-alloy steels embrittled by \nservice exposure, may be susceptible to brittle failure. Several failures have been attributed to brittle \nfracture of steels that were exposed to temperatures below their transition temperature and to pressures \ngreater than 25 % of the required hydrostatic test pressure or 8 ksi of stress, whichever is less. Most brittle \nfractures, however, have occurred on the first application of a high stress level (the first hydro test or \noverload). The potential for a brittle failure shall be evaluated by an engineer prior to hydrostatic testing or \nespecially prior to pneumatic testing because of the higher potential energy involved. Special attention \nshould be given when testing low-alloy steels, especially 11/4Cr-1Mo, because they may be prone to temper \nembrittlement. \nTo minimize the risk of brittle fracture during a pressure test, the metal temperature should be maintained \nat least 30 ¬∞F (17 ¬∞C) above the minimum design metal temperature ( MDMT) for piping that is more than 2 in. \n(5 cm) thick, and 10 ¬∞F (6 ¬∞C) above the MDMT for piping that have a thickness of 2 in. (5 cm) or less. The \ntest temperature need not exceed 120 ¬∞F (50 ¬∞C) unless there is information on the brittle characteristics of \nthe piping construction material indicating that a higher test temperature is needed. \n5.11.5 Precautions and Procedures \nDuring a pressure test, where the test pressure will exceed the set pressure of the PRD on a piping system, \nthe PRD (s) should be removed or blanked for the duration of the test. As an alternative, each valve disk \nshall be held down by a suitably designed test clamp. The application of an additional load to the valve \nspring by turning the adjusting screw is prohibited. Other appurtenances that are incapable of withstanding \nthe test pressure, such as gage glasses, pressure gages, expansion joints, and rupture disks, should be \nremoved or blanked. Lines containing expansion joints that cannot be removed or isolated may be tested \nat a reduced pressure in accordance with the principles of ASME B31.3. If block valves are used to isolate \na piping system for a pressure test, caution should be used to not exceed the permissible seat pressure, \nas described in ASME B16.34 or applicable valve manufacturer data. \nUpon completion of the pressure test, PRDs of the proper settings and other appurtenances removed or \nmade inoperable during the pressure test shall be reinstalled or reactivated. \nBefore applying a pressure test, appropriate precautions and procedures should be considered to ensure \nthe safety of personnel involved with the pressure test. A close visual inspection of piping components \nshould not be performed until the equipment pressure is at or below the MAWP. This review is especially \nimportant for in-service piping. \n5.11.6 Pressure Testing Alternatives \nAppropriate NDE shall be specified and conducted when a pressure test is not performed after a major repair or\n alteration. Substituting NDE procedures for a pressure test after an alteration is allowed only after \nthe engineer and inspector have approved the substitution. \nFor cases where UT is used in lieu of a pressure test, the owner-operator shall specify industry-qualified \nUT angle beam examiners. ASME B31 Code Case 179 may be used in lieu of RT for B31.1 piping welds, \nand alternative UT acceptance criteria provided in B31 Code Case 181 may be used in lieu of those \ndescribed in paragraph 344.6.2 of ASME B31.3, as applicable, for closure welds that have not been \npressure tested and for welding repairs identified by the engineer or the inspector. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n5.12 Material Verification and Traceability \n5.12.1 General \nThe owner-operator shall assess the need for and extent of application of a material verification program \nconsistent with API 578 addressing inadvertent material substitution in existing alloy piping systems. A \nmaterial verification program consistent with API 578 may include procedures for prioritization and risk \nranking of piping circuits. That assessment may lead to retroactive positive material identification ( PMI) \nexamination, as described in API 578, to confirm that the installed materials are consistent with the intended \nservice. Components identified during this verification that do not meet acceptance criteria of the PMI \nexamination program (such as in API 578) would be targeted for replacement. The owner-operator and \nauthorized piping inspector, in consultation with a corrosion specialist, shall establish a schedule for \nreplacement of those components. The authorized inspector shall use periodic NDE, as necessary, on the \nidentified components until the replacement. \nDuring repairs or alterations to alloy material piping systems, where the alloy material is required to maintain \npressure containment, the inspector shall verify that the installation of new materials is consistent with the selected or specified construction materials. This material verification program should be consistent with \nAPI 578. Using risk assessment procedures, the owner-operator can make this assessment by 100 % \nverification, PMI examination in certain critical situations, or by sampling a percentage of the materials. PMI \nexamination can be accomplished by the inspector or the examiner with the use of suitable methods as \ndescribed in API 578. \nIf a piping system component should fail because an incorrect material was inadvertently substituted for the proper piping material, the owner-operator shall determine the need for further verification of existing \npiping materials. The extent of further verification will depend upon circumstances, such as the \nconsequences of failure and the probability of further material errors. \n5.12.2 Carbon Steel Sulfidation \nCarbon steel\n pipe having less than 0.1 wt% silicon can corrode at significantly higher rates than carbon \n(260 ¬∞C) and subject to sulfidation corros ion. For piping systems/circuits that have been identified in \nsulfidation corrosion service (see API 578) that may contain older low-silicon carbon steels, consideration \nshould be given to conducting inspection of each piping component/segment/weld or spool to identify the \nworst-case corrosion rate limiting component. \nAfter about 1985, most purchased pipe became double stamped, and hence the low-silicon issue \ndiminished for piping purchased and installed after that time frame. Inspection techniques that can be useful \nfor finding susceptible components under insulation include real-time RT, guided wave examination, and \nPEC. Inspection plans for sulfidation corrosion should be in accordance with API 939-C. \n5.12.3 Carbon Steel in Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation Unit Process \nResidual elements (Cr, Ni, and Cu) in carbon steel have been found to increase corrosion rates of carbon \nsteels significantly in some services exposed to hydrofluoric (HF) acid in refining alkylation process. API \n751 contains additional information on the need for material verification and increased corrosion monitoring for steels in such service conditions. \n5.13 Inspection of Valves \nTypically, thickness measurements are not routinely taken on valves in piping circuits. Information on types \nof valves can be found in API 574. The body of a valve is normally thicker than other piping components \nfor design reasons. However, when valves are dismantled for servicing and repair, the shop personnel \nshould visually examine the valve components for any unusual corrosion patterns or thinning and, when \nnoted, report that information to the inspector. Bodies of valves that are exposed to significant temperature \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nycling (for example, catalytic reforming unit regeneration and steam cleaning) should be examined \nperiodically for thermal fatigue cracking. \nIf gate valves are known to be or are suspected of being exposed to severe or unusual corrosion-erosion, \nthickness readings should be conducted on the body between the seats because this is an area of high \nturbulence and high stress. \nControl valves or other throttling valves, particularly in high-pressure drop and slurry services, can be \nsusceptible to localized corrosion-erosion of the body downstream of the orifice. If such metal loss is \nsuspected, the valve should be removed from the line for internal inspection. The inside of the downstream \nmating flange and piping also should be inspected for local metal loss. \nWhen valve body and/or closure pressure tests are performed after servicing, they should be conducted in \naccordance with API 598. \nCritical check valves (CCV) shall be inspected or tested to provide greater assurance that they will prevent \nflow reversals. CCVs should be defined and identified by the owner-operator based on a risk assessment \nof the valve‚Äôs function to prevent a potentially hazardous event should back-flow of a process fluid occur. \nThis may include the possibility of overpressure, equipment damage, fluid contamination, inadvertent \nmixing, increased corrosion, or other undesirable effects. It is not expected that every check valve be \ndesignated as a CCV. Owner-operators may utilize process hazards assessment tools, such as HAZOP \n(hazard and operability study) and LOPA (layers of protection analysis), to identify when these scenarios \npose an unacceptable risk. \nAn example of a CCV may be the check valve located on the outlet of a multistage, high-head \nhydroprocessing charge pump. Failure of such a check valve to operate correctly could result in \noverpressuring piping and equipment not rated for the higher discharge pressures and in damage to the \npump due to the reverse rotation of the impeller (s). \nCCVs should be uniquely identified and tracked, for example, on ISOs, on process and instrumentation \ndiagram s, and in the Inspection Data Management System ( IDMS). Inspection frequencies for CCVs should \nbe set by the owner-operator based on service performance, noted deficiencies upon inspection, and \ninspection history. \nLeak checks of CCVs are normally not required but may be considered for special circumstances. \nAdditional information on valve inspection can be found in API 574 and API 621. \n5.14 In-service Inspection of Welds \nInspection for piping weld quality is normally accomplished as a part of the requirements for new construction, repairs,\n or alterations. However, welds are often inspected for corrosion as part of a RT profile \ninspection or as part of on-stream. When preferential weld corrosion is noted, additional welds in the same \ncircuit or system should be examined for corrosion. API 577 provides additional guidance on weld \ninspection. \nDue to the different capabilities and characteristics of various NDE methods to find flaws, using an NDE method that\n is different from the one employed during original fabrication may reveal preexisting flaws that \nwere not caused by in-service exposure (e.g. applying UT and MT for in-service inspection when only RT \nwas applied during fabrication). For this reason, it is often a good practice to specify the types of NDE during \noriginal fabrication that the owner-operator plans to apply during in-service insp ections. \nOn occasion, RT profile examinations of welds that have been in-service may reveal a flaw in the weld. If \ncrack-like imperfections are detected while the piping system is in operation, further inspection with weld \nquality RT and/or UT should be used to assess the magnitude of the imperfection. Additionally, the inspector \nshould try to determine whether the crack-like imperfections are from original weld fabrication or may be \nfrom an environmental cracking mechanism. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nrack-like flaws and environmental cracking shall be assessed by an engineer in accordance with API 5791/ASME FFS-1 and/or corrosion specialist. Preferential weld corrosion shall be assessed by the inspector \nand/or corrosion specialist. Issues to consider when assessing the quality of existing welds include the \nfollowing: \na)original fabrication inspection method and acceptance criteria;\nb)extent, magnitude, and orientation of imperfections;\nc)length of time in-service;\nd)operating versus design conditions;\ne)presence of secondary piping stresses (residual and thermal);\nf)potential for fatigue loads (mechanical and thermal);\ng)primary or secondary piping system;\nh)potential for impact or transient loads;\ni)potential for environmental cracking;\nj)repair and heat treatment history;\nk)dissimilar metal welds, such as ferritic-to-austenitic and alloy 400 to carbon steel welds;\nl)weld hardness.\nFor in-service piping weldments, it may not be appropriate to use the original construction code RT \nacceptance criteria for weld quality in ASME B31.3. The ASME B31.3 acceptance criteria are intended to \napply to new construction on a sampling of welds, not just the welds examined, to assess the probable \nquality of all welds (or welders) in the system. Some welds may exist that will not meet these criteria but \nwill still perform satisfactorily in-service after being hydrostatically tested. This is especially true on small \nbranch connections that are normally not examined during new construction. \nThe owner-operator shall specify industry-qualified UT angle beam examiners when the owner-operator \nrequires either of the following items: \na)detection of interior surface (ID) bre aking planar flaws when inspecting from the external surface (OD);\nb)where detection, characterization, and/or through-wall sizing is required of planar flaws; applicationexamples for the use of such industry-qualified UT angle beam examiners include obtaining flawdimensions for Fitness-For-Service assessment and monitoring of known flaws.\n5.15 Inspection of Flanged Joints \nFlanged joints should be examined for evidence of leakage, such as stains, deposits, or drips. Process \nleaks onto flange fasteners and valve bonnet fasteners may result in corrosion or environmental cracking. \nThis examination should include those flanges enclosed with flange or splash-and-spray guards. Flanged \njoints that have been clamped and pumped with sealant should be checked for leakage at the bolts. \nFasteners subjected to such leakage may corrode or crack ( e.g. caustic cracking). If repumping is bein g \nconsidered, ultrasonic examination of the bolts before repumping may be necessary to assess their integrity \ndepending upon the process conditions to which they are exposed. Refer to ASME PCC-2. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nAccessible flange faces should be examined for distortion and to determine the condition of gasket-seating \nsurfaces. Gasket-seating surfaces damaged and likely to result in a joint leak should be resurfaced prior to \nbeing placed back in-service. Special attention should be provided to flange faces in high-temperature/high-pressure hydroprocessing services prone to gasket leaks during start-up and on-stream. If flanges are \nexcessively bent or distorted, their markings and thicknesses should be checked agains t engineering \nrequirements. \nFlange fasteners should be examined visually for corrosion and thread engagement. Fasteners shall be \nfully engaged for the full depth of the nut on new and reassembled bolted joints. Fasteners not fully engaged \non existing bolted joint assemblies may be considered acceptably engaged if the lack of complete engagement is not more than one thread. Refer to ASME PCC-1 for more details. \nThe markings on a representative sample of newly installed fasteners and gaskets should be\n examined to \ndetermine whether they meet the material specification. The markings are identified in the applicable ASME \nand ASTM standards. Questionable fasteners should be verified or renewed. \nGuidance on inspection and repair of flanged joints can be found in ASME PCC-2, Article 305, and ASME \nPCC-1. Additionally, ASME PCC-1‚ÄîAppendix A provides guidance for establishing criteria for the training \nand qualifications of bolted joint assembly personnel. Such training and qualifications may prevent flange \njoint leaks. Owner-operators may follow the guidance in this ASME PCC-1‚ÄîAppendix A with their own \ntraining and qualification program or utilize an external organization providing such services. This appendix \nalso provides guidance for the training, qualification, duties, and responsibilities for qualified bolting \nspecialists and instructors engaged in the inspection and quality assurance of the assembly and disassembly of bolted joints. \n5.16 Inspection of Piping in HF Acid Alkylation Process Units \nPiping systems in HF acid alkylation units shall be inspected according to API 751 requirements and \nrecommended practices and this code‚Äôs requirements and recommendations.",

Piping systems (sometimes referred to as corrosion \nsystems or loops) are a collection of piping circuits usually related to a common process intent/function and \nare typically defined at a process flow diagram level. Piping circuits are often defined at the process and \ninstrumentation diagram (P&ID) level. Potential damage mechanisms are primarily a function of the \nprocess/operating conditions, the material of construction, and mechanical design. Defining systems and \ncircuits based upon potential damage mechanisms is the first step in creating an effective inspection plan. \nSystemization is the first cut for defining the potential corrosion issues, and is a convenient reference to the \ngeneral location of damage mechanisms within the process unit. Piping systems generally have common \ncharacteristics, such as one or more of the following: \na)process intent (e.g. overhead reflux system);\nb)process control scheme ( e.g. temperature/end point);\nc)process stream composition;\nd) design operating conditions;\ne)similar or related set of IOWs.\nPiping systems may contain (or pass through) one or more equipment items ( e.g. exchangers and pumps) \nand will typically contain one or multiple piping circuits. Piping systems and circuits developed from \nexpected/identified damage mechanisms enable the development of concise inspection plans and form the \nbasis for improved data analysis. Piping circuitization is a further breakdown of piping systems into sections \nof piping and/or individual pipe components, which have common damage mechanisms and same material \nof construction and have similar damage rates and modes. \nRefer to API 574 for more information o n development of piping systems and circuits. \n5.1.2 Development of an Inspection Plan \nAn inspection plan shall be established for all piping systems and/or circuits and associated PRDs within \nthe scope of this code. The inspection plan shall be developed by the inspector and/or engineer. \nA corrosion specialist shall be consulted to identify susceptibilities to credible damage mechanisms and \npotential locations. Some examples include the following: \na)localized corrosion;\nb)cracking;\nc)CUF;\nd)metallurgical damage;\ne)piping systems that operate at elevated temperatures [above 750 ¬∞F (400 ¬∞C)];\nf)piping systems that operate below the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature.\nSpecial attention in the inspection plan should be given to any types of deterioration or issues listed in 5.4.2. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nThe inspection plan is developed from the analysis of several sources of data, including the piping \ninspection records. Piping systems shall be evaluated based on present or possible types of damage \nmechanisms. The method and extent of the NDE technique shall be based off of the ability for it to detect \nthe damage mechanism. Subdividing piping systems into circuits subject to common damage mechanisms \nfacilitates the development of an inspection strategy and plan and selecting the inspection techniques best \nsuited to find the damage that is most likely to occur in the piping circuit. Examinations shall be scheduled \nat intervals that consider the following: \na) damage mechanisms (see API 571);\nb)rate of damage progression;\nc)tolerance of the equipment to the type of damage;\nd)capability of the NDE method to identify the damage;\ne)maximum intervals as defined in codes and standards;\nf)extent of examination;\ng)recent operating history, including IOW exceedances;\nh)MOC records that may impact inspection plans;\ni)RBI assessments or piping classification.\nThe inspection plan should be developed using the most appropriate sources of information, including those \nreferences listed in Section 2. Inspection plans shall be reviewed and amended as needed when variables \nare identified that could impact damage mechanisms and/or deterioration rates (as defined by the owner-operator). See API 574 for more information on the development of inspection plans. \nThe inspection plan shall contain the inspection tasks and schedule required to monitor identified damage \nmechanisms and ensure the mechanical integrity of the piping systems. The plan should: \na)define the type(s) of inspection needed ( e.g. internal, external, on-stream, and nonintrusive);\nb)identify the next inspection date for each inspection type;\nc)describe the inspection methods and NDE techniques;\nd)describe the extent and locations of inspection and NDE at CMLs;\ne)describe the surface cleaning requirements needed for inspection and examinations for each type ofinspection;\nf)describe the requirements of any needed pressure test ( e.g. type of test, test pressure, test temperature,\nand duration);\ng)describe any required repairs if known or previously planned before the upcoming inspection;\nh)describe the types of damage anticipated or experienced in the piping systems;\ni)define the location of the expected damage;\nj)define any special access and preparation needed.\nGeneric inspection plans based on industry standards and practices may be used as a starting point in \ndeveloping specific equipment inspection plans. The inspection plan may or may not exist in a single \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n5.2 RBI \n5.2.1 General \nAn RBI evaluation may be used to determine inspection intervals or due dates and the type and extent of \nfuture inspection/examinations. An RBI assessment determines risk by combining the probability and the \nconsequence of piping system failure. When an owner-operator chooses to conduct an RBI assessment, it \nshall include the minimum program requirements as established by API 580. API 581 provides a set of \nsemi-quantitative methodologies for assessing risk (both probability of failure and consequence of fail ure) \nand for developing inspection plans that are consistent with key elements defined in API 580. \nKey steps evaluat e both the probability and consequence of a failure. I dentifying and evaluating credible \ndamage mechanisms, current piping condition, and the effectiveness of the past inspections are important \nsteps in assessing the probability of piping failure. Identifying and evaluating the process fluid(s), potential \ninjuries, environmental damage, piping system damage, and piping system downtime are important steps \nin assessing the consequence of piping failure. Identifying and implementing IOWs for key process \nvariables is an important adjunct to RBI (see 4.3.1.4), as well as any other method of planning and \nscheduling inspections. \n5.2.2 Documentation \nIt is essential that all RBI assessments be thoroughly documented in accordance with the requirements in \nAPI 580 clearly defining all the factors contributing to both the probability and consequence of a failure of \nthe equipment. \nAfter an RBI assessment is conducted, the results can be used to establish the equipment inspection plan and better\n define the following: \na)the most appropriate inspection and NDE methods, tools, and techniques;\nb)the extent of NDE ( e.g. percentage of equipment to examine);\nc)the interval or due date for internal (where applicable), external, and on-stream inspections;\nd)the need for pressure testing after damage has occurred or after repairs/alterations have beencompleted;\ne) the prevention or mitigation steps to reduce the probability or consequence of equipment failure when\nnecessary to reduce risk to an acceptable level (e.g. repairs, process changes, and inhibitors).\n5.2.3 Frequency of RBI Assessments \nWhen RBI assessments are used to set equipment inspection intervals or due dates, the assessment shall \nbe updated after each equipment inspection as defined in API 580.

Scheduled inspections shall be conducted on or before their due date or be \nconsidered overdue for inspection. Alternatively, an inspection due date may be determined through a risk \nassessment in accordance with API 580. This RBI-determined due date may exceed the typical half-life \nan inspection interval, some generate an inspection due date based on acceptable risk criteria. See 7.13 \nfor more information and requirements on overdue inspections and deferrals.) \nThe appropriate inspection shall provide the information necessary to determine that all the essential \nsections or components of the equipment are safe to operate until the next scheduled inspection. The risks \nassociated with operational shutdown and start-up and the possibility of increased corrosion due to \nexposure of equipment surfaces to air and moisture during shutdown should be evaluated when an internal \ninspection is being planned. \nThis code is based upon monitoring a representative sampling of inspection locations on selected piping \nwith specific intent to reveal a reasonably accurate assessment of the condition of the piping. An RBI \nassessment according to API 580 may provide an inspection plan for groups of piping circuits assessed. \n6.1.2 Life Cycle of Piping \nPiping has different levels of activity and operation throughout its life c ycle, per the various definitions. In \nFigure 2, the various stages are identified and are explored in greater detail in API 574 as to how pipe and \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nts multiple components are manufactured, joined, and operated. The varying operational stages may \nrequire specific activities or tracking of activities. \nThis code does not include piping systems that are still under construction or in transport to the site prior to \nbeing placed in-service or piping systems that have been retired. \nIn the operational part of the life cycle p iping systems that are not currently in operation due to a temporary \noutage of the process, turnaround, or other maintenance activity are still considered to be ‚Äú in-service.‚Äù Idled \npiping that is subsequently brought into operational service shall be highlighted to the mechanical integrity \nprogram owner to reflect current status. Installed spare piping is also considered in-service, whereas spare \npiping that is not installed is not considered in-service. \nFigure 2‚ÄîLife Cycle of Piping Systems \n6.2 Inspection d uring Installation and Service Changes \n6.2.1 Piping Installation \nPiping should have been inspected in accordance with code of construction and all contractual \nrequirements during fabrication and installation. The purpose of installation inspection is to verify that the \npiping is clean and safe for operation and to initiate plant inspection records for the piping systems. The \nminimum installation inspection should include the following items: \na)verifying that piping is installed correctly, the correct metallurgy is installed, supports are adequate andsecured, exterior attachments ( such as supports, shoes, and hangers) are secured, insulation isproperly installed, flanged and other mechanical connections are properly assembled, and the pipingis clean and dry;\nb) verifying that the PRDs satisfy design requirements (correct device and correct set pressure) and areproperly installed.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nThis installation inspection should document baseline thickness measurements to be used as initial \nthickness readings for corrosion rate calculations in lieu of nominal and minimum design thickness data in \nspecifications and design data sheets/drawings. This will also facilitate the creation of an accurate corrosion \nrate calculation after the first in-service thickness measurements are recorded. \n6.2.2 Piping Service Change \nIf the service conditions of the piping system are changed‚Äîi.e. will exceed the current operating envelope \ntemperature) ‚Äîinspection intervals shall be established for the new service conditions, including the review \nof applicable PRD settings. \nIf both the ownership and the location of the piping are changed, the piping shall be inspected before it is \nreused. Also, the allowable service conditions and the inspection interval shall be established for the new \nservice. \n6.3 Piping Inspection Planning \n6.3.1 General \nThe frequency and extent of inspection on piping circuits whether above or below ground depend on the \nforms of degradation that can affect the piping and consequence of a piping failure. The various forms of \ndegradation that can affect process piping circuits are described in API 571 in more detail. \nA simplified classification of piping based on the consequence of failure is defined in 6.3.4. The classification \nis used to establish frequency and extent of inspection. The owner-operator may devise a more extensive \nclassification scheme that more accurately assesses consequence for certain piping circuits. The \nconsequence assessment would consider the potential for explosion, fire, toxicity, environmental impact, \nand other potential effects associated with a failure. Refer to API 580 regarding the guidelines on assessing \nthe consequence of failure. As described in 5.2, inspection strategy based on probability and consequence \nof failure is referred to as RBI. \nAfter an effective assessment is conducted, the results can be used to establish a piping circuit inspection strategy\n and define the appropriate inspection plan per 5.1. \n6.3.2 Setting Inspection Intervals with RBI \nAn RBI assessment, in accordance with API 580, may be used to determine the inspection intervals or next \ninspection due date and extent of inspection for piping, as well as the inspection and testing intervals for \nassociated pressure relief devices. \n6.3.3 Setting Inspection Intervals without the Use of RBI \nThe owner-operator or the inspector shall establish inspection intervals for thickness measurements and \nexternal visual inspections and, where applicable, for internal and supplemental inspections. \nIf RBI is not being used, the interval between piping inspections should be established and maintained by \nusing the following criteria: \na)the corrosion rate and remaining life calculations;\nb)the piping service classification (see 6.3.4);\nc)and the judgment of the inspector, the piping engineer, the piping engineer supervisor, or a corrosionspecialist based on operating conditions, previous inspection history, current inspection results, andonditions that may warrant supplemental inspections covered in 5.5. 7.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nFor Class 1, 2, and 3 piping, the period between thickness measurements for CMLs or circuits should not \nexceed one-half the remaining life, or the maximum intervals recommended in Table 1, whichever is less. \nWhenever the remaining life is less than 4 years, the thickness measurement inspection interval may be \nthe full remaining life up to a maximum of 2 years. \nTable 1‚Äî Recommended Maximum Inspection Intervals c \nType of Circuit Thickness Measurements Visual External \nClass 1 5 years 5 years \nClass 2 10 years 5 years \nClass 3 10 years 10 years \nClass 4 Optional Optional \nInjection points a 3 years By class \nSAIs b ‚Äî By class \nNOTE Thickness measurements apply to systems for which CMLs have been established in accordance with 5.6. \na Inspection intervals or due dates for potentially corrosive injection/mix points can also be established by a valid RBI analysis \nin accordance with API 580. Injection and mix points can be extended beyond 3 years if deemed relatively noncorrosive after \nreview from a corrosion specialist. \nb See API 574 for more information on SAIs. \nc The maximum inspection intervals can be modified by the owner-operator with the application of RBI that meets the \nrequirements contained in API 580. \nMaximum intervals for Class 4 piping are left to the determination of the owner-operator depending upon \nreliability and business needs. \nFor piping that is in noncontinuous service, the interval between thickness measurements may be based \non the number of years of actual service (piping in operation) instead of calendar years, provided that when \nidled, the piping is as follows: \na)isolated from the process fluids;\nb)not exposed to corrosive internal environments (e.g. inert gas purged or filled with noncorrosivehydrocarbons); piping that is in noncontinuous service and not adequately protected from corrosiveenvironments may experience increased internal corrosion while idle; t he corrosion rates should becarefully reviewed before setting the intervals.\nThe inspection interval shall be reviewed and may be adjusted after each inspection. The inspection interval \nshould also be reviewed when operating outside of a predetermined IOW exceedance threshold. General \ncorrosion, localized corrosion, pitting, environmental cracking, and other applicable forms of deterioration \nmentioned in 5. 4, and API 571 shall be considered when establishing the various inspection intervals. \n6.3.4 Piping Service Classes \n6.3.4.1 General \nAll process piping systems shall be categorized into different piping classes except for piping that has been planned\n based on RBI. Such a classification system allows extra inspection efforts to be focused on piping \nsystems that may have the highest potential consequences if failure or loss of containment should occur. \nIn general, the higher classified systems require more extensive inspection at shorter intervals to affirm \ntheir integrity for continued safe operation. Classifications should be based on potential safety and \nenvironmental effects should a leak occur. When pipe service conditions change, pipe classifications and \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nnspection plans should be reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect the changed operating conditions \n(e.g. a hydrocarbon service temperature increase that might change from ‚Äúslowly vaporizing during a \nrelease‚Äù to ‚Äúrapidly vaporizing during a release‚Äù). \nOwner-operator shall maintain a record of process piping fluids handled, including their classifications. \nNFPA 704 provides information that may be helpful in classifying piping systems according to the potential \nhazards of the process fluids they contain. \nNOT E The operating temperature of a hydrocarbon stream relative to its flash point, boiling point, and autoignition \ntemperature is a significant factor in defining potential consequence of a release. Operating temperature of hydrocarbon \npiping systems should be considered when assigning piping service class. For example, on-site ambient temperature \ngaso line is Class 2 because it is below the boiling point but above the flash point of gasoline. However, on-site gasoline \nat 550 ¬∞F should be Class 1 since autoignition can occur. \nThe four classes listed below in 6.3.4.2 through 6.3.4.5 are recommended. \n6.3.4.2 Class 1 \nServices with the highest potential of resulting in an immediate emergency if a leak were to occur are in \nClass 1. Such an emergency may be safety or environmental in nature. Examples of Class 1 piping include, \nbut are not necessarily limited to, those containing the following: \na)flammable services that can autorefrigerate and lead to brittle fracture;\nb) pre ssurized services that can rapidly vaporize during release, creating vapors that can collect and forman explosive mixture, such as C2, C3, and C4 streams; f luids that can rapidly vaporize are those withatmospheric boiling temperatures below 50 ¬∞F (10 ¬∞C) or where the atmospheric boiling point is belowthe operating temperature (typically a concern with high-temperature services);\nc)hydrog en sulfide (greater than 3 % weight) in a gaseous stream;\nd) anh ydrous hydrogen chloride;\ne)HF acid (e.g. in HF alkylation units, as discussed in API 751, etc.);\nf)pipin g over or adjacent to water and piping over public throughways (refer to national or local regulations\n[e.g. the Department of Transportation and Coast Guard] for inspection of over water piping);\ng)flammable services operating above their autoignition temperature.\n6.3.4.3 Class 2 \nServices not included in other classes are in Class 2. This classification includes most of the unit process \npiping and selected off-site piping. Typical examples of these services include but are not necessarily \nlimited to those containing the following: \na) on-site hydrocarbons that will slowly vaporize during release, such as those operating below the boilin gpoint but above the flash point;\nb) on-site hydrogen, fuel gas, and natural gas;\nc)on-site strong acids and caustics.\n6.3.4.4 Class 3 \nServices that are either flammable but do not significantly vaporize when they leak, i.e. below the flash \npoint, or flammable but are in remote areas and operate below the boiling point are in Class 3. Services \nthat are potentially harmful to human tissue but are in remote areas may be included in this class. Examples \nof Class 3 service include, but are not necessarily limited to, those containing the following: \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\na) on-site hydrocarbons that will not significantly vaporize during release such as those operating belowthe flash point;\nb)off-site distillate and product lines to and from storage and loading;\nc)tank farm piping;\nd)off-site acids and caustics;\ne)off-site hydrogen, fuel gas, and natural gas;\nf)other lower risk hydrocarbon piping that does not fall in Class 1, 2, or 4.\n6.3.4.5 Class 4 \nServices that are essentially nonflammable and nontoxic are in Class 4, as are most utility services. \nInspection of Class 4 piping is optional and usually based on reliability needs and business impacts as \nopposed to safety or environmental impact. Examples of Class 4 service include, but are not necessarily \nlimited to, those containing the following: \na)steam and steam condensate;\nb)air;\nc)nitrogen;\nd)water, including boiler feed water or stripped sour water;\ne)lube oil and seal oil;\nf)ASME B31.3, Category D services;\ng)plumbing and sewers.\n6.4 Extent of Visual External and CUI Inspections \nExternal visual inspections, including inspections for CUI, should be conducted in accordance with 6.3.3. \nAlternatively, external visual inspection intervals or due dates can be established by using a valid RBI \nassessment conducted in accordance with API 580. This external visual inspection for potential CUI is also \nto assess insulation condition and shall be conducted on all piping systems susceptible to CUI. The results \nof the visual inspection should be documented to facilitate follow-up inspections. \nFollowing the external visual inspection of susceptible systems, additional examination is required for the inspection\n of CUI. The extent and type of the additional CUI inspection are listed in Table 2. Damaged \ninsulation at higher elevations may result in CUI in lower areas remote from the damage. NDE inspection \nfor CUI should also be conducted as listed in Table 2 at suspect locations operating between 10 ¬∞F ( ‚àí12 ¬∞C) \nand 350 ¬∞F (175 ¬∞C) for carbon steel and low-alloy steel piping. Piping that may be determined to not fall \nwithin this range but may cycle in and out of the range or may be susceptible to CUI during shutdowns and \nshould be considered. RT or insulation removal and visual inspection is normally required for this inspection \nat damaged or suspect locations. Other NDE assessment methods may be used where applicable. If the \ninspection of the damaged or suspect areas has located significant CUI, additional areas should be \ninspected and, where warranted, up to 100 % of the circuit should be inspected. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nTable 2‚Äî Recommended Extent of CUI Inspection Following Visual Inspection for Susceptible \nPiping aPipe Class At Damaged Insulation Locations At Nondamaged Locations \n(No Visual Damage Identified d uring Visual \nExamination) \nApproximate Amount of Examination \nwith NDE or Insulation Removal at Areas \nwith Damaged Insulation Approximate Amount of CUI Inspection with \nNDE or Insulation Removal at Areas without \nDamaged Insulation b \n1 75 % 50 % \n2 50 % 33 % \n3 25 % 10 % \n4 Optional Optional \na Susceptible piping is piping systems operating within the susceptible temperature ranges as indicated in API 574. \nb The third column are additional areas to consider inspecting and not progressive from the second column. \nThe extent of the CUI program described in Table 2 should be considered as target levels for piping systems \nand locations with no CUI inspection experience. It is recognized that several factors may affect the \nlikelihood of CUI to include the following: \na)local climatic conditions;\nb)insulation design and maintenance;\nc)coating quality;\nd)service conditions.\nFacilities with CUI inspection experience may increase or reduce the CUI inspection targets of Table 2. An exact\n accounting of the CUI inspection targets is not required. The owner-operator may confirm inspection \ntargets with operational history or other documentation. \nPiping systems that are known to have a remaining life of over 10 years or that are adequately protected \nagainst external corrosion need not be included for the NDE inspection recommended in Table 2. However, \nthe condition of the insulating system or the outer jacketing, such as a cold-box shell, should be observed \nperiodically by operating or other personnel. If deterioration is noted, it should be reported to the inspector. \nThe following are examples of these systems: \na)piping systems insulated effectively to preclude the entrance of moisture;\nb)jacketed cryogenic piping systems;\nc)piping systems installed in a cold box in which the atmosphere is purged with an inert gas;\nd)piping systems in which the temperature being maintained is sufficiently low or sufficiently high topreclude the presence of water.\nThe external visual inspection on bare piping is to assess the condition of paint and coating systems, to check for\n external corrosion, and to check for other forms of deterioration. \n6.5 Extent of Thickness Measurement Inspection and Data Analysis \n6.5.1 CML Monitoring \nTo satisfy inspection interval requirements, each thickness measurement inspection should obtain thickness \nreadings on a representative sampling of the total number of CMLs on each circuit (see 5.6). It is not the intent \nof this code that every established CML needs to be measured each time. A statistical sampling of active \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nMLs is an acceptable approach, for a circuit-based analysis per the provisions outlined in 6.5.3. In addition, \nsome CMLs may be documented as inactive and therefore do not need to be measured and would not be \nconsidered overdue. This representative sampling should include data for all the various types of components \nand orientations (horizontal and vertical) found in each circuit. This sampling also shall include CMLs with the \nearliest renewal date as of the previous inspection. Where general thinning is predicted, this sampling should \ninclude all the various types of components within the circuit. Where localized damage mechanisms are \nidentified, sampling should also include the location and orientation (top/bottom, inside/outside radius, etc.) \nwhere the damage is most likely to occur. The number and specific CMLs to be monitored at each inspection \nshall be determined by the inspector in consultation with a piping engineer and/or corrosion specialist where \nnonuniform corrosion or other damage mechanisms are expected. Therefore, scheduled inspection of circuits \nshould obtain as many measurements as necessary to satisfactorily monitor the type and extent of damage \nanticipated in each piping system. If RBI is used to set the inspection interval or due date, CMLs not required \nfor inspection per the RBI assessment do not need to be inspected in accordance with the recommended \nmaximum inspection intervals in Table 1. \nTo determine the extent of thickness measurements necessary to develop a corrosion rate and remaining \nlife, two basic approaches are acceptable as discussed below. \n6.5.2 Point-to-Point Method \nThis analysis method is where the corrosion rate, remaining life, and reinspection interval are determined \nfor each individual CML without adjustment for the results of other CML measurements in the circuit. Future \ninspections are managed based on the 1/2 life established at each CML location. During a reinspection of a \npiping system, all the CMLs may be reinspected or only those that are coming due. This method can lead \nto frequent inspections of the same piping system if not carefully managed. It is generally not possible to apply \na statistical analysis with the point-to-point method since 1) a relationship of one CML to another has not been \nestablished, making it difficult to compare corrosion rates in the circuit or between CMLs, and 2) the individual \nCML rates may be generated over significantly different time periods, when operating conditions may have \nchanged. \n6.5.3 Circuit Analysis Method \nWhere piping has been circuitized into common corrosion mechanisms and expected rates, a statistical analysis \nmay be used to determine the appropriate number of representative sample points, a representative circuit \ncorrosion rate, and the inspection interval. There are a number of considerations for using a statistical analysis \napproach that are necessary to remain appropriately conservative, some of which include the following. \na)Approach is generally applicable to damage mechanisms that produce uniform corrosion. However,\nwhen considering localized corrosion, the approach must be constructed for proper application.\nb)Locations that exhibit significantly different corrosion rates and locations with shorter remaining life mayneed to\n be analyzed separately and/or moved to separate circuits.\nc)A sampling statistic should be considered to check the statistical confidence factor given the variabilityof the data\n set (within a circuit).\nd)The number of data points (CMLs) may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired statistical confidencebefore\n employing a statistical methodology.\ne)A safety factor or confidence interval, which may be dependent on the expected damage mechanismsand may additionally account for circuit complexity, should be considered to account for uncertaintiessuch as measurement error and overall failure risk.\nf)CML reinspection shall not be extended beyond the date projected to reach the established minimumrequired thickness. Absolute limits should be considered for reinspection of CMLs based on thelikelihood of failure (e.g. time or thickness limit).\ng)Depending on the statistical analysis method used, the data population should be tested to make sur et meets the criteria for the distribution type utilized in the analysis.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nAs a minimum, the worst-case CMLs (those that are driving the need for the next inspection (e.g. those \nwith the highest corrosion rate and/or the lowest remaining corrosion allowance) within the circuit shall be \ninspected at the next established inspection interval. \n6.5.4 Data Analysis \nSome level of data analysis is recommended under both approaches discussed above. Since the calculated \ncorrosion rate used to predict the future remaining life was a product of the prior operating history, it is \nimportant to check for any acceleration of the corrosion rate over time and to be aware of planned \noperational changes. Good quality MOC and IOW programs are beneficial where critical process variables \nthat may affect corrosion/damage rate or susceptibility are tracked. Additional data analysis should consider \nthe following. \na)Is the measured rate within the expected/predicted range?\nb)Is the short rate significantly different from the long rate?\nc)Has the variability (or standard deviation) within the circuit data increased significantly over time?\nd) Do components, orientations, sections within the circuit, or other identifiable features of the circuitexhibit significantly different rates?\ne)Have data anomalies been resolved, either through a review process or verification readings, prior t odata analysis?\nf)Has the impact on results from measurement error in the technique used been incorporated?\nIn general, both approaches should be developed considering the potential active damage mechanisms \nwithin the piping system. Representative CMLs should be primarily based on the locations where the \ndamage mechanisms are likely to be most active but should also include a sampling of all sizes, \norientations, component types, and design features ( e.g. control valve stations, equipment inlets/outlets, \nand alternate flow piping) within the line or circuit. This sampling also shall include CMLs with the earliest \nrenewal date as of the previous inspection. \nFor general corrosion, it may not be necessary to identify the specific orientation of the examination point. \nWhere localized damage mechanisms are expected, sampling should include the orientation (top/bottom, \ninside/outside radius, etc.) to help identify the specific active mechanism and provide data for future \nadjustments to CML locations. \nStatistical tools may be used to determine or adjust the CML quantities when prior data are available. For \nnew circuits or those with a change in-service, data from a similar service may be applied to estimate CML \nquantities and/or locations. Circuit inspections should include as many measurements as necessary to \nsatisfactorily monitor the type and extent of damage anticipated in each piping system. CMLs that are not \ndriving the next inspection interval do not necessarily need to be inspected in accordance with the \nrecommended maximum inspection intervals in Table 1. If a circuit statistical analysis method is to be \nperformed, a representative sampling of all CMLs should be taken to avoid skewing the data. \nRepresentative sampling is not an important consideration using the point-to-point method. \nIn addition, some CMLs may be documented as ‚Äúinactive‚Äù or ‚Äúarchived. ‚Äù These are CML points that have \nessentially been eliminated from the active registry but are being maintained for historical record purposes. \nThere are several reasons to consider inactivating or archiving CMLs, including inappropriate placement of \nCML, sufficient coverage by other CMLs, lack of historical corrosion activity, etc. Although these CMLs may \nbe maintained within the system (or electronic IDMS), they do not need to be measured on calculated \nintervals and would not be considered as overdue. \n6.5.5 Review and Verification of Thickness Data Accuracy \nEach owner-operator should have a procedure in place to provide for a review and/or verification of \nthickness data accuracy when data errors/anomalies are suspected. Such a procedure will reduce the \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n chances for thickness data anomalies being used in the process of calculating short and LT corrosion rates, \nwhich in turn could affect the scheduled inspection interval and remaining life calculation. To help reduce \ninaccuracies in thickness data taking, examiners should have training and procedures that address the 10 \nfactors included in 5.7.1 that can contribute to reduced accuracy of ultrasonic thickness measurements. \nWhen thickness data measure errors/anomalies are suspected ( e.g. thickness growths or losses of 10 % \nor more), then implementation of a data verification process may be warranted. Such a procedure/work \nprocess may include validation of the questionable measurements with: \na) additional thickness measurements being repeated at the CML(s) in question; \nb) use of another trained NDE technician or inspector to take the validation readings; \nc) use of a different, calibrated thickness measuring device to take the validation readings; \nd) review and corrective action implemented for any of the other applicable factors listed in 5.7.1 that may \nhave been a factor in the questionable readings. \nWhen questionable thickness measurements have been validated, inspection records should be updated \nto note that the reading(s) has been validated and/or changed and which reading should be used in the succeeding data analysis. \n6.6 Extent of Inspections on SBP, Deadlegs, Auxiliary Piping, and Threaded Connections \n6.6.1 SBP \nSBP that is primary process piping shall be inspected in accordance with all the requirements of this \ndocument. As with larger diameter piping, inspection practices for SBP shall have inspection plans based \nupon credible damage mechanisms in API 571 other than just wall thinning ( e.g. stress corrosion cracking, \nhydrogen-induced cracking, embrittlement, etc.). Specific attention should be paid to damage that may have \nbeen inflicted by mechanical overloading on SBP since the strength and support systems for SBP are \nsometimes not adequate to avoid overload ( e.g. vents, drains, and bridles). \nWhere RBI is not in use, SBP that is secondary process piping has different minimum requirements \ndepending upon service classification. Class 1 and Class 2 secondary SBP shall be inspected to the same \nrequirements as primary process piping. Inspection of Class 3 and Class 4 secondary SBP is optional at \nthe owner-operator ‚Äôs discretion depending upon reliability and risk. \nInsulated SBP should receive the same inspection practices for CUI as the primary piping or vessels to \nwhich it is attached. Insulation stripping and RT are the preferred inspection methods for insulated SBP. \nAttention should be paid to insulation system resealing on SBP. \nReference API 574 for multiple design, fabrication, installation, and operating issues that can affect the \nlikelihood of failure for SBP systems. \n6.6.2 Deadleg Inspection \nDeadlegs, including both large-bore piping and SBP (e.g. level bridles), can be areas of increased corrosion \nrequiring special attention if they are deemed potentially corrosive by a corrosion specialist because of the \naccumulation of contaminated water, solid materials, different temperatures from the main line, or the \naccumulation or concentration of corrosive species ( e.g. ammonium salts, organic acids, hydrogen sulfide, \nand acidic deposits). Risk assessment can be useful in determining which piping system deadlegs may be \na higher threat to accelerated corrosion than active piping circuits. Deadlegs that are part of primary piping \nsystems should be considered at greater risk because of the inability to valve them off in the event of a leak \nand the higher potential consequence of a large leak. \nConsideration should be given to coordinating with operations to identify and remove potentially corrosive \ndeadlegs that are deemed nonessential in order to reduce risk and inspection workload. Corrosion \nspecialists should be consulted for placement of CMLs on deadlegs because of their potential for localized corrosion, especially about accelerated corrosion above and below liquid interfaces. Infrared thermography \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nay be useful for locating liquid interfaces in deadlegs. Inspections of horizontal deadlegs that may not be \nliquid full should have examination points in all four quadrants of any CMLs. \nPotentially corrosive deadlegs with CMLs should be tracked in a separate piping circuit from the mainline \npiping. These deadlegs or low points are typically identified and documented in the inspection records and \non inspection ISOs. Deadlegs may be combined into the primary piping circuit if their anticipated damage \nmechanisms and corrosion rates are similar. Inspections should include profile RT on small diameter \ndeadlegs (less than or equal to 8‚Äù), such as vents and drains, and scanning UT or RT on larger diameter \ndeadlegs. Other examination techniques for deadlegs include EMAT and PEC. Profile RT should be \nemployed for deadlegs that may be susceptible to fouling deposits that could cause under deposit corrosion \nor other integrity problems ( e.g. fouling in relief lines). \nDeadlegs that may collect water and be susceptible to freezing from external ambient conditions should be \nadequately insulated and heat traced for such cases. \nNOTE Deadleg areas of a hot piping system that was defined as outside the CUI range can potentially be operating \nwithin the CUI temperature range or be exposed to CUI during downtime. When this is identified, then guidance related \nto CUI inspection from 6.4 should be applied. \nSome examples include blanked (blinded) branches, lines with normally closed block valves, lines with one \nend blanked, pressurized dummy support legs, stagnant control valve bypass piping, spare pump piping, \nlevel bridles, PRD inlet and outlet header piping, pump trim bypass lines, high-point vents, sample points, \ndrains, bleeders, and instrument connections. Deadlegs also include piping that is no longer in use but still \nconnected to the process. \n6.6.3 Auxiliary Piping Inspection \nInspection of auxiliary SBP associated with instruments and machinery is typically to be determined by risk \nassessment, including impacts on process safety and reliability. Criteria to consider in determining whether \nauxiliary SBP will need some form of inspection include the following: \na) piping classification;\nb)potential for environmental or fatigue cracking, particularly on nonbraced SBP ( e.g. reciprocating andentrifugal compressors, flow-induced vibration);\nc)potential for corrosion based on experience with adjacent primary systems (especially since auxiliarySBP thickness will be thinner and likely results in full penetration corrosion sooner than in the primarypipe);\nd)potential for CUI;\nNOTE See CUI inspection section for special requirements on auxiliary piping. Auxiliary piping systems canpotentially be operating within the CUI range even though the primary piping system operates outside the CUItemperature range.\ne)potential for fatigue and erosion and/or corrosion on thermowells.\n6.6.4 Threaded-connection Inspection and MitigationInspection of threaded connections should be according to the requirements listed above for small-bore \nand auxiliary piping. RT is an effective inspection method for these connections, which can help identify \nlocalized corrosion in the annular space between the threads and the amount of thread engagement and \nidentify uniform wall loss from corrosion. \nSBP connections associated with rotating equipment, especially threaded connections, are often subject to \nfatigue damage. Due to the nature of fatigue damage and its rapid progression from crack initiation to final \nfracture, inspection is not a primary method for failure mitigation. Fatigue failures are best prevented \nthrough proper design of the joint or branch connection, such as eliminating exposed threads by covering \nthe threads with a seal weld/‚Äúbridge‚Äù weld, reducing or eliminating any overhanging wei ght, or providing \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\ntwo-plane gussets to the small-bore branch connections. When seal-welding threaded connections, pay \nclose attention to weld prep cleanliness to avoid welding defects and cover all threads completely. \nSBP in known vibratory service should be periodically assessed and considered for possible renewal with \na thicker wall or upgrading joint design. The need for such renewal will depend on the potential risk of \nfailure, including the following: \na)classification of piping;\nb)magnitude and frequency of vibration;\nc)amount of unsupported weight;\nd)current piping wall thickness;\ne)whether or not the system can be maintained on-stream;\nf)corrosion rate;\ng)intermittent service.\n6.7 Inspection and Maintenance of PRDs\n6.7.1 GeneralPRDs shall be inspected, tested, maintained, and repaired in accordance with this document and API 576. \nRepairs and maintenance shall be conducted by a repair organization qualified and experienced in PRD \nmaintenance per definition in 3.1.9 2. \n6.7.2 Quality Assurance Process for PRDs \nEach PRD repair organization shall have a fully documented quality assurance system. As a minimum, the \nfollowing shall be included in the quality assurance manual: \na)title page;\nb) revision log;\nd)statement of authority and responsibility;\ne) organizational chart;\nf)scope of work;\ng)drawings and specification controls;\nh)requirements for material and part control;\ni)repair and inspection program;\nj)requirements for welding, NDE, and heat treatment;\nk)requirements for valve testing, setting, leak testing, and sealing;\nl)general example of the valve repair nameplate;\nm)requirements for calibrating measurement and test gauges;\nn)requirements for updating and controlling copies of the quality control manual;\no) sample forms;\np)training and qualifications required for repair personnel;\nq)requirements for handling of non-conformances.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nEach repair organization shall also have a documented training program that shall verify that repair \npersonnel are qualified within the scope of the repairs they will be conducting. \n6.7.3 PRD Testing and Inspection Intervals \n6.7.3.1 General \nPRDs shall be tested and inspected at intervals that are frequent enough to verify that the valves perform \nreliably in the service conditions. Other PRDs (e.g. rupture disks and vacuum-breaker valves) shall be \ninspected at intervals based on service conditions. The inspection interval for all PRDs is determined by \nthe inspector, engineer, or other qualified individual per the owner-operators quality assurance system. \n6.7.3.2 PRD Testing and Inspection Intervals \nUnless documented experience and/or an RBI assessment indicates that a longer interval is acceptable, \ntest and inspection intervals for PRDs in typical process services should not exceed: \na)5 years for typical process services;\nb)10 years for clean (nonfouling) and noncorrosive services.\n6.7.3.3 As-received Condition, Testing, and Actions \nWherever possible, as-received relief ( pop) testing should be conducted prior to cleaning to yield accurate \nas-received pop testing results that will help establish/justify the appropriate inspection and servicing \ninterval. \nCleaning of deposits prior to as-received relief ( pop) testing can remove deposits that would have prevented \nthe valve from opening at set pressure. Refer to API 576 for more information on as-received pop testing \nand cleaning with adjacent piping. \nNOTE In some services, such as HF acid alkylation units, care needs to be taken to ensure safe handling and \nprotection of personnel (refer to API 576 for further guidance). \nWhen a PRD is found to be heavily fouled or stuck, or when a PRD fails an as-received relief ( pop) test, \nthe inspection and testing interval shall be reevaluated to determine if the interval should be shortened or \nother corrective action taken. The owner-operator should define the criteria that constitute an ‚Äú as-received‚Äù \nrelief ( pop) test failure. The owner-operator may define criteria for failure based on as-received relief ( pop) \ntest pressure as a percentage of cold differential set pressure. Unless specified by the owner-operator, a \npressure relief device is considered stuck when it has not relieved ( popped) at 150 % of its set pressure. \nAn investigation consistent with the principles documented in API 585 should be undertaken to determine \nthe cause of the fouling or the reasons for the PRD not operating properly. Refer to API 576 for additional \ninformation on PRD relief ( pop) test results and investigations.",

Scheduled inspections shall be conducted on or before their due date or be \nconsidered overdue for inspection. Alternatively, an inspection due date may be determined through a risk \nassessment in accordance with API 580. This RBI-determined due date may exceed the typical half-life \nan inspection interval, some generate an inspection due date based on acceptable risk criteria. See 7.13 \nfor more information and requirements on overdue inspections and deferrals.) \nThe appropriate inspection shall provide the information necessary to determine that all the essential \nsections or components of the equipment are safe to operate until the next scheduled inspection. The risks \nassociated with operational shutdown and start-up and the possibility of increased corrosion due to \nexposure of equipment surfaces to air and moisture during shutdown should be evaluated when an internal \ninspection is being planned. \nThis code is based upon monitoring a representative sampling of inspection locations on selected piping \nwith specific intent to reveal a reasonably accurate assessment of the condition of the piping. An RBI \nassessment according to API 580 may provide an inspection plan for groups of piping circuits assessed. \n6.1.2 Life Cycle of Piping \nPiping has different levels of activity and operation throughout its life c ycle, per the various definitions. In \nFigure 2, the various stages are identified and are explored in greater detail in API 574 as to how pipe and \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nts multiple components are manufactured, joined, and operated. The varying operational stages may \nrequire specific activities or tracking of activities. \nThis code does not include piping systems that are still under construction or in transport to the site prior to \nbeing placed in-service or piping systems that have been retired. \nIn the operational part of the life cycle p iping systems that are not currently in operation due to a temporary \noutage of the process, turnaround, or other maintenance activity are still considered to be ‚Äú in-service.‚Äù Idled \npiping that is subsequently brought into operational service shall be highlighted to the mechanical integrity \nprogram owner to reflect current status. Installed spare piping is also considered in-service, whereas spare \npiping that is not installed is not considered in-service. \nFigure 2‚ÄîLife Cycle of Piping Systems \n6.2 Inspection d uring Installation and Service Changes \n6.2.1 Piping Installation \nPiping should have been inspected in accordance with code of construction and all contractual \nrequirements during fabrication and installation. The purpose of installation inspection is to verify that the \npiping is clean and safe for operation and to initiate plant inspection records for the piping systems. The \nminimum installation inspection should include the following items: \na)verifying that piping is installed correctly, the correct metallurgy is installed, supports are adequate andsecured, exterior attachments ( such as supports, shoes, and hangers) are secured, insulation isproperly installed, flanged and other mechanical connections are properly assembled, and the pipingis clean and dry;\nb) verifying that the PRDs satisfy design requirements (correct device and correct set pressure) and areproperly installed.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nThis installation inspection should document baseline thickness measurements to be used as initial \nthickness readings for corrosion rate calculations in lieu of nominal and minimum design thickness data in \nspecifications and design data sheets/drawings. This will also facilitate the creation of an accurate corrosion \nrate calculation after the first in-service thickness measurements are recorded. \n6.2.2 Piping Service Change \nIf the service conditions of the piping system are changed‚Äîi.e. will exceed the current operating envelope \ntemperature) ‚Äîinspection intervals shall be established for the new service conditions, including the review \nof applicable PRD settings. \nIf both the ownership and the location of the piping are changed, the piping shall be inspected before it is \nreused. Also, the allowable service conditions and the inspection interval shall be established for the new \nservice. \n6.3 Piping Inspection Planning \n6.3.1 General \nThe frequency and extent of inspection on piping circuits whether above or below ground depend on the \nforms of degradation that can affect the piping and consequence of a piping failure. The various forms of \ndegradation that can affect process piping circuits are described in API 571 in more detail. \nA simplified classification of piping based on the consequence of failure is defined in 6.3.4. The classification \nis used to establish frequency and extent of inspection. The owner-operator may devise a more extensive \nclassification scheme that more accurately assesses consequence for certain piping circuits. The \nconsequence assessment would consider the potential for explosion, fire, toxicity, environmental impact, \nand other potential effects associated with a failure. Refer to API 580 regarding the guidelines on assessing \nthe consequence of failure. As described in 5.2, inspection strategy based on probability and consequence \nof failure is referred to as RBI. \nAfter an effective assessment is conducted, the results can be used to establish a piping circuit inspection strategy\n and define the appropriate inspection plan per 5.1. \n6.3.2 Setting Inspection Intervals with RBI \nAn RBI assessment, in accordance with API 580, may be used to determine the inspection intervals or next \ninspection due date and extent of inspection for piping, as well as the inspection and testing intervals for \nassociated pressure relief devices. \n6.3.3 Setting Inspection Intervals without the Use of RBI \nThe owner-operator or the inspector shall establish inspection intervals for thickness measurements and \nexternal visual inspections and, where applicable, for internal and supplemental inspections. \nIf RBI is not being used, the interval between piping inspections should be established and maintained by \nusing the following criteria: \na)the corrosion rate and remaining life calculations;\nb)the piping service classification (see 6.3.4);\nc)and the judgment of the inspector, the piping engineer, the piping engineer supervisor, or a corrosionspecialist based on operating conditions, previous inspection history, current inspection results, andonditions that may warrant supplemental inspections covered in 5.5. 7.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nFor Class 1, 2, and 3 piping, the period between thickness measurements for CMLs or circuits should not \nexceed one-half the remaining life, or the maximum intervals recommended in Table 1, whichever is less. \nWhenever the remaining life is less than 4 years, the thickness measurement inspection interval may be \nthe full remaining life up to a maximum of 2 years. \nTable 1‚Äî Recommended Maximum Inspection Intervals c \nType of Circuit Thickness Measurements Visual External \nClass 1 5 years 5 years \nClass 2 10 years 5 years \nClass 3 10 years 10 years \nClass 4 Optional Optional \nInjection points a 3 years By class \nSAIs b ‚Äî By class \nNOTE Thickness measurements apply to systems for which CMLs have been established in accordance with 5.6. \na Inspection intervals or due dates for potentially corrosive injection/mix points can also be established by a valid RBI analysis \nin accordance with API 580.

                "TEXT": "7.1 Corrosion Rate Determination \n7.1.1 General \nThe owner-operator may use either the point-to-point analysis method or a statistical analysis method, or a \ncombination of both, to determine the LT or short-term (ST) corrosion rates. \n7.1.2 Point-to-Point Method \nThe LT corrosion rate of an individual CML shall be calculated from the following formula: \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\ninitial actualCorrosion rate (LT) time (years) between and initial actualtttt‚àí=\nThe ST corrosion rate of an individual CML shall be calculated from the following formula: \nprevious actualCorrosion rate (ST) time (years) between and previous actualtttt‚àí\n=\nwhere \ntinitial is the thickness, in inches (millimeters), at the same location as tactual measured at initial \ninstallation or at the commencement of a new corrosion rate environment; \ntprevious is the thickness, in inches (millimeters), at the same location as tactual measured during one or more previous inspections. \nLT and ST corrosion rates should be compared to see which results in the shortest remaining life as part \nof the data assessment. The authorized inspector, in consultation with a corrosion specialist, shall select \nthe corrosion rate that best reflects the current process (see 6.3.3 for inspection interval determination). \nMeasurement error exists in all systems and should be well defined or understood and where possible \ncontained in narrow error bands. This is particularly important in ST corrosion rate use where the error bands may result in misleading decisions. \nThe inspector should consult with a corrosion specialist when the ST corrosion rate changes from the \nanticipated or previously identified rate to determine the cause (see API 574 for wider guidance). \nAppropriate responses to accelerated corrosion rates may include the following: \na)obtaining additional UT thickness readings;\nb)using profile RT in lieu of, or to supplement UT readings;\nc)performing UT scans in suspect areas;\nd)performing other corrosion/process monitoring;\ne)reviewing changes in operations/process;\nf)revising the piping inspection plan;\ng)addressing non-conformances.\nCircuit corrosion rates should be estimated based on the anticipated damage mechanisms and operating \nconditions with a tolerance or range identified. Measured rates exceeding the established range signal the \nneed to review the potential causes and adjust the inspection plan. \n7.1.3 Statistical Analysis Method \nThe owner-operator may elect to use a statistical analysis method (e.g. probability plots or related tools) to \nestablish a representative corrosion, remaining life estimate, and/or reinspection date. Any statistical \napproach shall be documented. The statistical treatment of data should be based on representation of the \nvarious pipe components within the circuit. Statistical analysis employing point measurements is not applicable to piping circuits with significant localized unpredictable corrosion mechanisms ( see additional \nnotes and statistical analysis in 6.5.3). There are many statistical tools that can be employed once piping \ncircuits have been properly established. While such calculations offer a convenient means to numerically \nsummarize circuit data, it is often the combination of descriptive statistics plus data visualization through \nstatistical plots that provide the most useful results. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nSee API 574 for additional discussion on statistical analysis methods. \n7.2 Remaining Life Calculations \nThe remaining life shall be calculated from the following formula: \nactual requiredRemaining life (years) corrosion rate [inches (mm) per year]tt ‚àí\n=\nwhere \ntactual is the actual thickness, in inches (millimeters), measured at the time of inspection for a \ngiven location or component as specified in 5.7. \ntrequired is the required thickness, in inches (millimeters), at the same location or component as \nthe actual measurement computed by the design formulas ( e.g. pressure and structural) \nbefore corrosion allowance and manufacturer‚Äôs tolerance are added. \n7.3 Newly Installed Piping Systems or Changes in Service \nFor a new piping system/circuit or for a piping system/circuit for which service conditions are being changed, \none of the following methods shall be used to determine piping system/circuits probable corrosion rate. The remaining life and inspection interval can be determined from this rate. \na)A corrosion rate may be calculated from data collected by the owner-operator on piping operating inthe same or similar service.\nb)A corrosion rate may be determined through appropriately placed ultrasonic sensors on the piping.\nc)A corrosion rate may be estimated by a corrosion specialist.\nd)A corrosion rate may be estimated from published data on piping in same or similar service.\nIf the probable corrosion rate cannot be determined by either method listed under a) or d) above, the initial \nthickness measurement should be established at appropriate intervals until a credible corrosion rate is \nestablished. Corrosion monitoring devices, such as corrosion coupons or corrosion probes, may be useful \nin establishing the timing of direct measurements. Subsequent measurements need to be established on \nappropriate intervals until the corrosion rate is established. If it is later determined that an inaccurate \ncorrosion rate was assumed, the corrosion rate in the remaining life calculations shall be amended to reflect the actual corrosion rate. \nIn a case where items listed a) through d) cannot be applied with confidence and to en sure that an \nunexpected, accelerated corrosion rate does not occur unidentified, the inspection plan shall include determining wall loss change rate on-stream by direct measurement techniques after 6 months of service. \nThis may not determine an actual corrosion rate (because of potential measurement error) but ensuring that data are available to direct the inspection plan until a corrosion rate can be established. This is provided \nas a cautionary guideline due to the statistical variation in thickness readings taken in short interval, which \nmay suggest a corrosion rate that is not truly indicative of the environment. \n7.4 Existing and Replacement Piping \nCorrosion rates shall be calculated using one of the methods identified in 7.1. For repaired or in-kind \nreplacement piping, the corrosion rate shall be established based on the previous worst-case measured \nrate at the replacement location or the circuit average rate. \nIf calculations indicate that an inaccurate rate of corrosion has been assumed, the rate to be used for the next period shall be adjusted to agree with the actual rate found. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7.5 MAWP Determination \nThe MAWP for the continued use of piping systems shall be established using the applicable code. \nComputations may be made for known materials if all the following essential details are known to comply \nwith the principles of the applicable code: \na)upper and/or lower temperature limits for specific materials;\nb)quality of materials and workmanship;\nc)inspection requirements;\nd)reinforcement of openings;\ne)any cyclical service requirements.\nFor unknown materials, computations may be made assuming the lowest-grade material and joint efficiency \nin the applicable code. When the MAWP is recalculated, the wall thickness used in these computations shall be the actual thickness as determined by inspection minus twice the estimated corrosion loss before the date of the next inspection (see 6.3.3). Allowance shall be made for the other loadings in accordance \nwith the applicable code. The applicable code allowances for pressure and temperature variations from the \nMAWP are permitted provided all the associated code criteria are satisfied. \nAnnex C contains two examples of calculations of MAWP illustrating the use of the corrosion half-life concept. \n7.6 Required Thickness Determination \nThe required thickness of a pipe shall be the greater of the pressure design thickness or the structural \nminimum thickness. For services with high risk, the piping engineer should consider increasing the required \nthickness to provide for unanticipated or unknown loadings, or undiscovered metal loss. See API 574, \nSection 10, for information on the determination of pressure design thicknesses, structural minimum \nthicknesses, minimum required thicknesses, and minimum alert thicknesses. Table 5 of API 574 provides \nexamples of minimum alert thicknesses and default minimum structural thicknesses for carbon and lowalloy steel piping operating below 400 ¬∞F (205 ¬∞C). \n7.7 Assessment of Inspection Findings \nPressure-containing components found to have damage that could affect their load-carry ing capability \n(pressure loads and other applicable loads, such as weight and wind) shall be evaluated for continued \nservice, or the piping should be removed from service until corrective action/repairs are performed. Fitness-For-Service evaluations, such as those documented in API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, should be used for this \nevaluation for the type of degradation being assessed. \nThe following techniques may be used as applicable. \na)To evaluate metal loss more than the corrosion allowance, a Fitness-For-Service assessment may beperformed in accordance with one of the following parts of API 579-1/ASME FFS-1. This assessmentrequires the use of a future corrosion allowance, which shall be established based on 7.1.\nb)Assessment of general metal loss ‚ÄîAPI 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 4.\nc)Assessment of local metal loss ‚ÄîAPI 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 5.\nd)Assessment of pitting corrosion‚ÄîAPI 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 6.\ne)To evaluate blisters and laminations, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed inaccordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 7. In some cases, this evaluation will require the use ofa future corrosion allowance, which shall be established based on 7.1.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n f) To evaluate weld misalignment and piping distortions, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be \nperformed in accordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 8. \ng) To evaluate crack-like flaws, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed in accordance with \nAPI 579-1/ ASME FFS-1, Part 9. \nh) To evaluate the effects of fire damage, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed in \naccordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 11. \n7.8 Piping Stress Analysis \nPiping shall be supported and guided so that: \na) its weight is carried safely; \nb) it has sufficient flexibility for thermal expansion or contraction; \nc) it does not vibrate excessively; \nd) accounts for other loads ( e.g. those included in the original code of construction). \nPiping flexibility is of increasing concern the larger the diameter of the piping and the greater the difference \nbetween ambient and operating temperature conditions. \nPiping stress analysis to assess system flexibility and support adequacy is not normally performed as part of a piping inspection. However, many existing piping systems were analyzed as part of their original design \nor as part of a rerating or modification, and the results of these analyses can be useful in developing \ninspection plans. When unexpected movement of a piping system is observed, such as during an external visual inspection (see 5.5.5), the inspector should discuss these observations with the pi ping engineer and \nevaluate the need for conducting a piping stress analysis. \nPiping stress analysis can identify the most highly stressed components in a piping system and predict the \nthermal movement of the system when it is placed in operation. This information can be used to concentrate \ninspection efforts at the locations most prone to fatigue damage from thermal expansion (heat up and cool down) cycles and/or creep damage in high-temperature piping. Comparing predicted thermal movements \nwith observed movement can help identify the occurrence of unexpected operating conditions and \ndeterioration of guides and supports. Consultation with the piping engineer may be necessary to explain observed deviations from the analysis predictions, particularly for complicated systems involving multiple supports and guides between end points. \nPiping stress analysis also can be employed to help solve observed piping vibration problems. The natural frequencies in which a piping system will vibrate can be predicted by analysis. The effects of additional \nguiding can be evaluated to assess its abili ty to control vibration by increasing the system ‚Äôs natural \nfrequencies beyond the frequency of exciting forces, such as machine rotational speed. It is important to \ndetermine that guides added to control vibration do not adversely restrict thermal expansion. \n7.9 Reporting and Records for Piping System Inspection \n7.9.1 Records \nPiping system owner-operators shall maintain records of their piping systems and PRDs. Records shall be \nmaintained throughout the service life of each piping system. As a part of these records, inspection and maintenance records shall be regularly updated to include new information pertinent to the operation, \ninspection, and maintenance history of the piping system. See also API 574 for more information of piping \nsystem records. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7.9.2 Types of Piping Records \nPiping system and PRD records shall contain four types of information pertinent to mechanical integrity as \nfollows. \na)Fabrication, construction, and design information to the extent available‚Äîf or example, manufacturer‚Äôsdata report s, material test report s, weld maps, welding procedure specification (WPS)/ procedur equalification record ( PQR), design specification data, piping design calculations, NDE records, heattreat records, PRD sizing calculations, and construction drawings.\nb) Inspection history ‚Äîfor example, inspection reports and data for each type of inspection conducted ( e.g.\ninternal, external, and thickness measurements) and inspection recommendations for repair. Inspectionreports shall document the date of each inspection and/or examination, the date of the next schedul ednspection, the name (or initials) of the person who performed the inspection and/or examination, theserial number or other identifier of the equipment inspected, a description of the inspection and/orexamination performed, and the results of the inspection and/or examination. When data are collectedusing equipment that requires calibration prior, during, or after use, calibration records should be provi dedw\nith the inspection results. Piping RBI records should be in accordance with API 580.\nc)Repair, alteration, and engineering evaluation information‚Äîfor example:\n1)repair and alteration forms if prepared;\n2)reports indicating that piping systems still in-service with either identified deficiencies, temporaryrepairs, or recommendations for repair are suitable for continued service until repairs can becompleted; and\n3)rerating documentation, including rerating calculations and new design conditions.\nd)Fitness-For-Service assessment documentation requirements are described in API 579-1/ASME FFS-1;\nspecific documentation requirements for the type of flaw being assessed are provided in the appropriat ep\nart of API 579-1/ASME FFS-1.\n7.9.3 Operating and Maintenance Records \nSite operating and maintenance records, such as operating conditions, including process upsets that may affect mechanical integrity, changes in-service, and mechanical damage from maintenance, should also be \navailable to the inspector. \n7.9.4 Computer Records \nA computer-based system for storing, calculating, and analyzing data‚Äîan IDMS ‚Äîshould be utilized when \nconsidering the volume of data that will be generated as part of a piping inspection program. The IDMS is useful for the following: \na)storing and analyzing the actual thickness readings;\nb) calculating ST and LT corrosion rates, retirement dates, and minimum required thickness;\nc)highlighting areas of high corrosion rates, piping close to the minimum required thickness, and otherinformation;\nd)inspection planning, including next inspection due dates, intervals, and deferrals;\ne)recommendations for repairs and their due dates;\nf)tracking temporary repairs.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7.9.5 Piping Circuit Records \nThe following information should be recorded for each piping circuit on which CMLs are located: \na)material of construction/piping specification;\nb)piping diameter;\nc)operating and design pressures and temperatures;\nd)ANSI flange rating;\ne)process fluids;\nf)piping classification (if RBI is not being used);\ng)insulation, heat tracing, postweld heat treatment (PWHT);\nh)whether the circuit is a deadleg, injection point, intermittent service, or other special circuit;\ni)the corrosion rate and remaining service life of, at least, the limiting examination point on the circuit;\nj)maximum interval for external inspection;\nk)maximum interval for thickness measurement inspection;\nl)any unusual or localized corrosion mode that would require specialized inspection techniques;\nm) circuit features that might subject it to rapid corrosion increases in the event of a process upset or lossof injection fluid flow.\n7.9.6 ISOs \nThe primary purpose of inspection ISOs is to identify the location of CMLs and to identify the location of \nany recommended maintenance. Inspection ISOs are recommended and should contain the following: \na)all significant components of the piping circuits ( e.g. all valves, elbows, tees, and branches);\nb)material of construction and specification breaks;\nc)all deadlegs, mix points, injection points, and other process connections to the primary piping system;\nd)diameter of piping;\ne)insulated or not;\nf)all secondary piping for Class 1 (or high-consequence RBI) piping circuits;\ng)secondary piping up to the block valve that is normally used for Class 2 (or appropriate RBIconsequence) unit pipe;\nh)all CMLs with appropriate information to locate the CMLs;\ni)adequate orientation and scale to provide legible detail;\nj)piping-circuit numbers and changes;\nk)continuation drawing numbers;\nl)location and type of pipe supports.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nnspection ISOs are recommended for all unit piping and all Class 1 (or high-consequence RBI) piperack \npiping on which CMLs have been identified for thickness measurement. Alternate methods for piperack \npiping that adequately describe the system without ISOs may be used. \nInspection ISOs are recommended for Class 2 (or appropriate RBI consequence) rack piping with CMLs, \nexcept that grid type drawings may be used if all other details are shown. The use of local details or local \nisometrics is acceptable to show the location of CMLs on grid drawings. \nInspection ISOs do not need to be drawn to scale or show dimensions unless necessary to locate CMLs. \n7.9.7 Inspection Reports and Records \nDocumented results (reports and/or records) of the inspection shall be approved by the responsible owner-operator inspector, engineer, or qualified designee. These should be posted into the appropriate IDMS \nwithin 90 days of either the completion of the inspection or the operational start-up of the associated \nequipment. \n7.10 Inspection Recommendations for Repair or Replacement \n7.10.1 General \nA management system for identifying, tracking, and periodically reviewing repair or replacement \nrecommendations (includes recommendations for non-conformances) that impact piping integrity is \nrequired and shall be kept current. The recommendation tracking system shall include the following: \na)recommended corrective action or repair;\nb) due or target date for completion of recommended action;\nc)piping system identifier (e.g. piping system or circuit number) that the recommendation affects;\nd)lists of temporary repairs that may require follow-up monitoring and eventual replacement;\ne) Fitness-For-Service or derating documentation, if necessary;\nf)any required monitoring or mitigation steps;\ng)date recommendation is made;\nh)planned repair date.\n7.10.2 Review of Inspection Repair Recommendations \nInspection repair recommendations can be changed or deleted after review by the inspector or inspection \nsupervisor and optionally by piping engineer. If inspect ion repair recommendations are changed or deleted, \ninspection records shall record the reasoning, date of change/deletion, and name of person who did the \nreview. \n7.11 Inspection Records for External Inspections \nResults of external piping system inspections shall be documented. A combination of checklist and narrative recordkeeping is recommended when documenting inspection results. Checklists should serve the purpose \nof reminding recordkeepers of all the issues important to be included in piping inspection records, but \nnarratives serve the purpose better than checklists for thoroughly documenting inspections results. The \nlocation of CUI inspections, either by insulation removal or NDE, should be identified. The location may be \nidentified by establishing a CML on the appropriate inspection ISO or with marked-up construction ISOs \nand narrative reports. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7.12 Piping Failure and Near-miss Reports \nFailures in piping that occur because of corrosion, cracking, or mechanical damage shall be recorded and \nreported to the owner-operator. Failures in piping systems shall be investigated to identify and correct the \ncause of failure. Near-misses in piping that occur from similar causes as failures should also be reported \nto the owner-operator and appropriately investigated to identify and correct the cause. See API 585 for \nmore information on how to investigate piping incidents ( i.e. failures, near-misses, and unanticipated \ndiscoveries). Temporary repairs to piping systems shall be documented in the inspection records. \n7.13 Deferral of Inspections, Tests, and Examinations \n7.13.1 General \nInspections, tests, or examinations for piping and associated PRDs that cannot be completed by their due \ndate may be deferred for a specified period, subject to the requirements in the following subsections. \nPiping or PRDs that are operated beyond the due date without a valid deferral in accordance with these \nrequirements are not permitted by this code. Deferrals should be the occasional exception, not a frequent \noccurrence. All deferrals shall be documented. Piping or PRDs that were granted a deferral can be operated \nto the new due date without being considered overdue for the deferred inspections, tests, or examinations. \n7.13.2 Simplified Deferral \nA simplified short-term deferral may be approved by the owner-operator if all the following conditions are met. \na)The current due date for the inspection, test, or examination has not been previously deferred.\nb)The proposed new due date would not increase the current inspection/servicing interval or due date bymore than 10 % or 6 months, whichever is less.\nc)A review of the current operating conditions, as well as the piping or PRD history, has been completedwith results that support a short-term/one-time deferral.\nd)The deferral request has the consent of the inspector representing or employed by the owner-operatorand an appropriate operations management representative(s).\ne)Updates to the piping or PRD records with deferral documentation are complete before it is operatedbeyond the original due date.\n7.13.3 Deferral \nDeferral requests not meeting the conditions of a simplified deferral shall follow a documented deferral procedure/pr ocess that includes all the following minimum requirements. \na)Perform a documented risk assessment or update an existing RBI assessment to determine if theproposed deferral date would increase risk above acceptable risk threshold levels as defined by theowner-operator. The risk assessment may include any of the following elements as deemed necessaryby the owner-operator:\n‚Äî fitness for service analysis results;\n‚Äî consequence of failure;\n‚Äî applicable damage mechanism susceptibilities and rates of degradation;\n‚Äî calculated remaining life;\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n‚Äî historical conditions/findings from inspections, tests, and examinations and their technical \nsignificance; \n‚Äî extent and/or probability of detection ( i.e. effectiveness) of previous inspections, tests, or \nexaminations, as well as the amount of time that has elapsed since they were last performed; \n‚Äî considerations for any previous changes to inspection or test intervals ( e.g. reductions in interval \ndue to deteriorating conditions); \n‚Äî disposition(s) of any previous requests for deferral on the same piping or PRD; \n‚Äî historical conditions/findings for piping or PRDs in similar service, if available. \nb)Determine if the deferral requires the implementation of or modification to existing IOWs or operatingprocess control limits.\nc)Review the current inspection plan to determine if modifications are needed to support the deferral.\nd)Obtain the consent and approval of appropriate piping personnel, including the inspector representi ngor employed by the owner-operator and appropriate operations management representative(s).\ne)Updates to the piping or PRD records with deferral documentation are complete before it is operatedbeyond the original due date.\n7.14 Deferral of Inspection Repair Recommendation Due Dates \nThe deferral of inspection recommendations should be the occasional exception not a frequent occurrence. \nInspection and repair recommendations that cannot be completed by their due date can be deferred for a \nspecific period. The deferral, including the justification of the due date and approval of the deferral by \nappropriate site personnel, shall be documented in the inspection records. At a minimum, this shall include \nthe inspector and inspection supervisor; however, the owner-operator should include the appropriate site \nmanagement representative when the authority to accept higher-than-normal operating risk is required. \nInspection recommendations that have not been completed by the required due date without a documented and approved deferral are considered overdue for completion. Piping and piping components shall remain \nat or above the minimum required thickness during the deferral period. The minimum required thickness \ncan be determined using methods defined in 7.6.",

Allowance shall be made for the other loadings in accordance \nwith the applicable code. The applicable code allowances for pressure and temperature variations from the \nMAWP are permitted provided all the associated code criteria are satisfied. \nAnnex C contains two examples of calculations of MAWP illustrating the use of the corrosion half-life concep\nSin√≥nimos ES: evaluaci√≥n de datos; an√°lisis; registros; vida remanente; corrosi√≥n; MAWP; t_min\nSynonyms EN: and recording api 570; and recording 4"

ASME B31.3 is written for design and construction of piping systems. However, \nmost of the technical requirements on design, welding, examination, and materials also can be applied in the \ninspection, rerating, repair, and alteration of operating piping systems. When ASME B31.3 cannot be followed \nbecause of its new construction coverage (such as revised or new material specifications, inspection \nrequirement s, certain heat treatments, and pressure tests), the piping engineer or inspector shall be guided by \nThe principles and practices of API 577 shall also be followed for all welded repairs and modifications. \nIf any of the restorative changes of a repair result in a change of design temperature or pressure, the requirements for rerating also shall be satisfied. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n8.1.2 Authorization \nAll repair and alteration work shall be done by a repair organization as defined in 4.3. 2 and shall be \nauthorized by the inspector prior to its commencement. Authorization for alteration work to a piping system \nmay not be given without prior consultation with, and approval by, the piping engineer. The inspector will \ndesignate any inspection hold points required during the repair or alteration sequence. The inspector may \ngive prior general authorization for limited or routine repairs and procedures, provided the inspector is \nsatisfied with the competency of the repair organization. \n8.1.3 Approval \nAll proposed methods of design, execution, materials, welding procedures, examination, and testing shall \nbe approved by the inspector or by the piping engineer, as appropriate. Owner-operator approval of on-stream welding is required. \nWelding repairs of cracks that occurred in-service should not be attempted without prior consultation with \nthe piping engineer to identify and correct the cause of the cracking. Examples are cracks suspected of \nbeing caused by vibration, thermal cycling, thermal expansion problems, and environmental cracking. \nThe inspector shall approve all repair and alteration work at designated hold points and after the repairs and\n8.1.4 Welding Repairs (Including On-stream) \n8.1.4.1 Temporary Repairs \nFor temporary repairs, including on-stream, a full encirclement welded split sleeve or box-type enclosure \ndesigned by the piping engineer may be applied over the damaged or corroded area. See various articles in ASME PCC-2 for more information on repairs to piping systems. Longitudinal cracks shall not be repaired \nin this manner unless the piping engineer has determined that cracks would not be expected to propagate from under the sleeve. The design of temporary enclosures and repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer. \nIf the repair area is localized (for example, pitting or pinholes) and the SMYS of the pipe is not more than 40,000 psi (275,800 kPa), and a Fitness-For-Service analysis shows that it is acceptable, a temporary \nrepair may be made by fillet welding a properly designed split coupling or plate patch over the pitted or \nlocally thinned area. The material for the repair shall match the base metal unless approved by the piping \nengineer. A f illet-welded patch shall not be installed on top of an existing fillet-welded patch. When installing \na fillet-welded patch adjacent to an existing fillet-welded patch, the minimum distance between the toe of \nthe fillet weld shall not be less than: \n4d Rt=\nwhere \nd is the minimum distance between the toes of fillet welds of adjacent fillet weld attachments, in \ninches (millimeters); \nR is the inside radius in inches (millimeters); \nt is the minimum required thickness of the fillet-welded patch in inches (millimeters). \nFor minor leaks and thinning below tmin, properly designed enclosures may be welded over the leak or thin \npiping while the piping system is in-service, provided the inspector is satisfied that adequate thickness \nremains in the actual location of the proposed weld and heat-affected zone, and the piping component can \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n withstand welding without the likelihood of further material damage, such as from caustic service. Any leak in \na Class 1 service, or where a risk ranking is determined to be high, shall be first reviewed by a piping \nengineer to determine if the work can be safely performed while the system remains on stream. \nTemporary repairs should be removed and replaced with a suitable permanent repair at the next available \nmaintenance opportunity. Temporary repairs may remain in place for a longer period only if approved and \ndocumented by the piping engineer. \n8.1.4.2 Permanent Repairs \nRepairs to defects found in piping components may be made by preparing a welding groove that completely \nremoves the defect and then filling the groove with weld metal deposited in accordance with 8.2. \nCorroded areas may be restored with weld metal deposited in accordance with 8.2. Surface irregularities \nand contamination shall be removed before welding. Appropriate NDE methods shall be applied after \ncompletion of the weld. \nIf it is feasible to take the piping system out of service, the defective area may be removed by cutting out a \ncylindrical section and replacing it with a piping component that meets the applicable code. \nInsert patches (flush patches) may be used to repair damaged or corroded areas if the following \nrequirements are met: \na) full-penetration groove welds are provided; \nb) for Class 1 and Class 2 piping systems, the welds shall be 100 % radiographed or ultrasonically tested \nusing NDE procedures that are approved by the inspector; \nc) patches may be any shape but shall have rounded corners [1 in. (25 mm) minimum radius]. See ASME \nPCC-2 for more information on various welded repairs to piping systems. \n8.1.5 Nonwe lded Repairs (On-stream) \nTemporary repairs of locally thinned sections or circumferential linear defects may be made on-stream by \ninstalling a properly designed and applied enclosure ( e.g. bolted clamp, nonmetallic composite wrap, \nmetallic and epoxy wraps, or another nonwelded applied temporary repair). The design shall include control \nof axial thrust loads if the piping component being enclosed is (or may become) insufficient to control \npressure thrust. The effect of enclosing (crushing) forces on the component also shall be considered. See \nASME PCC-2 for more information on nonmetallic composite wrap repair methods. \nDuring turnarounds or other appropriate opportunities, temporary leak sealing and leak dissipating devices, \n(e.g. wire wrapping, mechanical clamps, etc.), including temporary repairs on valves, shall be removed and \nappropriate actions taken to restore the original integrity of the piping system. The inspector and/or piping \nengineer shall be involved in determining repair methods and procedures. Temporary leak sealing and leak \ndissipating devices may remain in place for a longer period only if approved and documented by the piping \nengineer. From a mechanical integrity perspective, injection fittings on valves to seal fugitive (LDAR) \nemissions from valve stem seal are not considered to be temporary repairs. Their removal or valve \nreplacement is at the discretion of the owner operator. \nProcedures that include leak sealing fluids (‚Äúpumping‚Äù) for process piping should be reviewed for acceptance by the\n inspector or piping engineer. The review should take into consideration the compatibility \nof the sealant with the leaking material; the pumping pressure on the clamp, especially when repumping, \nand any resulting crushing forces; the risk of sealant affecting downstream flow meters, PRDs, or \nmachinery; the risk of subsequent leakage at bolt threads causing corrosion or stress corrosion cracking of \nbolts; and the number of times the seal area is repumped. \nSee ASME PCC-2 for more information on nonwelded repairs for piping systems. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n 8.2 Welding and Hot Tapping \n8.2.1 General \nAll repair and alteration welding shall be done in accordance with the principles of ASME B31.3 or the code \nto which the piping system was built. \nAny welding conducted on piping components in operation shall be done in accordance with API 2201. The \ninspector shall use as a minimum the ‚ÄúSuggested Hot Tap Checklist‚Äù contained in API 2201 for hot tapping \nperformed on piping components. See API 577 for further guidance on hot tapping and welding in-service. \n8.2.2 Procedures, Qualifications, and Records \nThe repair organization shall use welders and welding procedures qualified in accordance with ASME B31.3 \nor the code to which the piping was built. See API 577 for guidance on welding procedures and \nqualifications. \nThe repair organization shall maintain records of welding procedures and welder performance \nqualifications. These records shall be available to the inspector prior to the start of welding. \n8.2.3 Preheating and PWHT \n8.2.3.1 General \nRefer to API 577 for guidance on preheating and PWHT. \n8.2.3.2 Preheating \nPreheat temperatures used in making welding repairs shall be in accordance with the applicable code and \nqualified welding procedure. Exceptions for temporary repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer. \nNOTE Preheating alone may not be considered as an alternative to environmental cracking prevention. \nPiping systems constructed of steels initially requiring PWHT normally are postweld heat treated if alterations or\n repairs involving pressure-retaining welding are performed. \n8.2.3.3 PWHT \nPWHT of piping system repairs or alterations should be made using the applicable requirements of ASME \nB31.3 or the code to which the piping was built. See 8.2.4 for an alternative preheat procedure for some \nPWHT requirements. Exceptions for temporary repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer and be in \naccordance with ASME PCC-2. \nLocal PWHT may be substituted for 360¬∞ banding on local repairs on all materials, provided the following \nprecautions and requirements are applied. \na) The application is reviewed, and a procedure is developed by the piping engineer. \nb) In evaluating the suitability of a procedure, consideration shall be given to applicable factors, such as \nbase metal thickness, thermal gradients, material properties, changes resulting from PWHT, the need \nfor full-penetration welds, and surface and volumetric examinations after PWHT. Additionally, the \noverall and local strains and distortions resulting from the heating of a local restrained area of the piping \nwall shall be considered in developing and evaluating PWHT procedures. \nc) A preheat of 300 ¬∞F (150 ¬∞C), or higher as specified by specific welding procedures, is maintained while \nwelding. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nd)The required PWHT temperature shall be maintained for a distance of not less than two times the basemetal thickness measured from the weld. The PWHT temperature shall be monitored by a suitabl enumber of thermocouples (a minimum of two) based on the size and shape of the area being heat treated.\ne)Controlled heat also shall be applied to any branch connection or other attachment within the PWHTarea.\nf)The PWHT is performed for code compliance and not for environmental cracking resistance.\n8.2.4 Preheat or Controlled Deposition Welding Methods as Alternatives to PWHT \n8.2.4.1 General \nIn some instances, full PWHT may have potential adverse effects on equipment and piping. Nevertheless, the piping\n may have been originally postweld heat treat ed or may require PWHT according to the original \nconstruction code. In these cases, preheat and controlled deposition welding may be used in lieu of PWHT, \nas described in 8.2.4.2 and 8.2.4.3. However, prior to using alternative methods, a piping engineer shall \nensure that the alternative is suitable based on a metallurgical review. The review shall consider factors \nsuch as the reason for the original PWHT, susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking, stresses in the location \nof the weld, susceptibility to high temperature hydrogen attack, susceptibility to creep, etc. \nThe welding method shall be selected based on the rules according to the applicable code /standard. I n \naddition, the adequacy of the as-welded joint at operating and pressure test conditions should be \nconsidered. \nWhen reference is made in this section to materials by the ASME designations, P-numbers and Group \nnumbers, the requirements of this section apply to the applicable materials of the original code of \nconstruction, either ASME or other, which conform by chemical composition and mechanical properties to \nthe ASME P-number and Group number designations. \nPressure boundary process piping alterations or repair welds that initially required PWHT shall be postweld heat\n treated, with the exceptions listed in 8.2.4.2 and 8.2.4.3. If valid for the current rated design, the original \njoint efficiency factor may be used when alternative PWHTs are practiced. \n8.2.4.2 Preheating Method (Notch Toughness Testing Not Required) \nThe preheating method, when performed in lieu of PWHT, is limited to the following materials and weld processes. \na)The materials shall be limited to P-No. 1, Group 1, 2, and 3, and to P-No. 3, Group 1 and 2 (excluding\nMn-Mo steels in Group 2).\nb)The welding shall be limited to the shielded metal arc welding, gas metal arc welding, gas tungsten arcwelding, and flux-cored arc welding processes.\nThe welders and welding procedures shall be qualified in accordance with the applicable rules of the original code of\n construction, except that the PWHT of the test coupon used to qualify the procedure shall be omitted. \nThe weld area shall be preheated and maintained at a minimum temperature of 300¬∞F (150 ¬∞C) during \nwelding. The 300 ¬∞F (150 ¬∞C) temperature should be checked to ensure that 4 in. (100 mm) of the material \nor four times the material thickness (whichever is greater) on each side of the groove is maintained at the \nminimum temperature during welding. The maximum interpass temperature shall not exceed 600 ¬∞F (315 ¬∞C). \nWhen the weld does not penetrate through the full thickness of the material, the minimum preheat and \nmaximum interpass temperatures need only be maintained at 4 in. (100 mm) or four times the depth of the \nrepair weld, whichever is greater on each side of the joint. \nThe use of the preheat alternative requires consultation with the piping engineer who should consider the potential for\n environmental cracking and whether the welding procedure will provide adequate toughness. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n Examples of situations where this alternative could be considered include seal welds, weld metal buildup \nof thin areas, and welding support clips. \nNOTE Notch toughness testing is not required when using this preheat method in lieu of PWHT. \n8.2.4.3 Controlled-deposition Welding Method (Notch Toughness Testing Required) \nThe controlled-deposition welding method may be used in lieu of PWHT in accordance wit h the following. \na) Notch toughness testing, such as that established by ASME B31.1‚Äî Chapter III, Section 323, is \nnecessary when impact tests are required by the original code of construction or the construction code \napplicable to the work planned. \nb) The materials shall be limited to P-No. 1, P-No. 3, and P-No. 4 steels. \nc) The welding shall be limited to the shielded metal arc welding, gas metal arc welding, flux-cored arc \nwelding, and gas tungsten arc welding processes. \nd) A weld procedure specification shall be developed and qualified for each application. The welding \nprocedure shall define the preheat temperature and interpass temperature and include the postheating \ntemperature requirement in item f) 8). The qualification thickness for the test plates and repair grooves \nshall be in accordance with Table 3. The test material for the welding procedure qualification shall be \nof the same material specification (including specification type, grade, class, and condition of heat \ntreatment) as the original material specification for the repair. If the original material specification is \nobsolete, the test material used should conform as much as possible to the material used for \nconstruction, but in no case shall the material be lower in strength or have a carbon content of more \nthan 0.35 %. \ne) When impact tests are required by the construction code applicable to the work planned, the PQR shall \ninclude sufficient tests to determine if the toughness of the weld metal and the heat-affected zone of \nthe base metal in the as-welded condition is adequate at the MDMT (such as the criteria used in ASME \nB31.3). If special hardness limits are necessary (for example, as set forth in NACE SP0472 and NACE \nMR0103) for corrosion resistance, the PQR shall include hardness tests as well. \nf) The WPS shall include the following add itional requirements. \n1) The supplementary essential variables of ASME BPVC, Section IX, paragraph QW-250, shall apply. \n2) The maximum weld heat input for each layer shall not exceed that used in the procedure \nqualification test. \n3) The minimum preheat temperature for welding shall not be less than that used in the procedure qualification\n test. \n4) The maximum interpass temperature for welding shall not be greater than that used in the \nprocedure qualification test. \n5) The preheat temperature shall be checked to en sure that 4 in. (100 mm) of the material or four \ntimes the material thickness (whichever is greater) on each side of the weld joint will be maintained \nat the minimum temperature during welding. When the weld does not penetrate through the full \nthickness of the material, the minimum preheat temperature need only be maintained at 4 in. (100 \nmm) or four times the depth of the repair weld, whichever is greater on each side of the joint. \n6) For the allowed welding processes in item c), use only electrodes and filler metals that are classified \nby the filler metal specification with an optional supplemental diffusible-hydrogen designator of H8 \nor lower. When shielding gases are used with a process, the gas shall exhibit a dew point that is \nnot higher than ‚Äì60 ¬∞F ( ‚Äì50 ¬∞C). Surfaces on which welding will be done shall be maintained in a \ndry condition during welding and free of rust, mill scale, and hydrogen-producing contaminants, \nsuch as oil, grease, and other organic materials. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7)The welding technique shall be a controlled-deposition, temper-bead, or half-bead technique. Thespecific technique shall be used in the procedure qualification test.\n8)For welds made by shielded metal arc welding, once filling is completed, do not allow the weldmentto cool below the minimum preheat temperature. In addition, raise the weldment temperature t o\n500 \n¬∞F ¬± 50 ¬∞F (260 ¬∞C ¬± 30 ¬∞C) for a minimum period of 2 hours. This assists outgassing diffusionof any weld metal hydrogen picked up during welding. This hydrogen bake-out may be omitt edw\nhen H4 filler metal (such as E7018-H4) is specified.\n9)After the finished repair weld has cooled to ambient temperature, the final temper beadreinforcement layer shall be removed substantially flush with the surface of the base material.\nRefer to WRC 412 for additional supporting technical information regarding controlled deposition welding. \nTable 3‚Äî Welding Methods as Alternatives to PWHT Qualification Thickness for Test Plates and \nRepair Grooves \nDepth t of Test Groove \nWelded a Repair Groove Depth \nQualified Thickness T of Test \nCoupon Welded Thickness Base Metal \nQualified \nt < t < 2 in. (50 mm) < T \nt < t ‚â• 2 in. (50 mm) 2 in. (50 mm) to unlimited \na The depth of the groove used for procedure qualification must be deep enough to allow removal of the required test specimen. \n8.2.5 Design \nButt joints shall be full-penetration groove welds. \nConnections and replacements shall be designed and fabricated according to the principles of the \napplicable code. The design of temporary enclosures and repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer. \nNew connections may be installed on piping systems provided the design, location, and method of \nattachment conform to the principles of the applicable code. \nFillet-welded patches require special design considerations, especially relating to weld-joint efficiency and \ncrevice corrosion. Fillet-welded patches shall be designed by the piping engineer. A patch may be applied \nto the external surfaces of piping, provided it is in accordance with 8.1. 4.1 and meets either of the following \nrequirements: \na)the proposed patch provides design strength equivalent to a reinforced opening designed according tothe\n applicable code;\nb)the proposed patch is designed to absorb the membrane strain of the part in a manner that is i naccordance with the principles of the applicable code, if the following criteria are met:\n1)the allowable membrane stress is not exceeded in the piping part or the patch;\n2)the strain in the patch does not result in fillet weld stresses exceeding allowable stresses for suchwelds;\n3)an overlay patch shall have rounded corners.\nDifferent components in the same piping system or circuit may have different design temperatures. In establishing the\n design temperature, consideration shall be given to process fluid temperatures, ambient \ntemperatures, heating and cooling media temperatures, and insulation. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n8.2.6 Materials \nThe materials used in making repairs or alterations shall be of known weldable quality, shall conform to the \napplicable code, and shall be compatible with the original material. For material verification requirements, \nsee 5.12. \nBrittle fracture occurrences have been experienced in some manufactured steel materials that are otherwise ex empted from toughness testing. Users have experienced brittle fracture of steel components \nduring new construction, repairs, and alterations to existing systems. Some of the materials involved \nincluded those produced to A105, A106, and A234 WPB spec ifications. Current ASTM specifications \nexempt many of these standard materials from toughness testing down to ‚àí20 ¬∞F. Increased risk may occur \nand be experienced in services that involve hydrotesting, operational temperatures down to ‚àí20 ¬∞ F, \nautorefrigeration, and depressurizing of systems involving LHC. Users are advised to evaluate the literature \n(see Bibliography) to be aware of this issue in case repairs, replacements, or modifications might be at risk \ndue to these low-toughness fittings. \n8.2.7 NDE \nAcceptance of a welded repair or alteration shall include NDE in accordance with the applicable code and \nAPI 577 shall also be\n followed. When surface and volumetric examinations are required, they shall be in \naccordance with ASME BPVC, Section V (or equivalent). \n8.2.8 Pressure Testing \nAfter welding is completed, a pressure test in accordance with 5.11 shall be performed if practical and \ndeemed necessary by the inspector. Pressure tests are normally required after alterations and major \nrepairs. See ASME PCC-2, Article 5.1, for more information on conducting pressure tests. When a pressure \ntest is not necessary or practical, NDE shall be utilized in lieu of a pressure test. Substituting appropriate \nNDE procedures for a pressure test after an alteration, rerating, or repair may be done only after \nconsultation with the inspector and the piping engineer. For existing insulated lines that are being pre ssure \ntested after repairs, rerating, or alterations, it is not necessary to strip insulation on all existing welds. \nPressure tests with longer hold times and observations of pressure gauges can be substituted for insulation \nstripping when the risks associated with leak under the insulation are acceptable. \nWhen it is not practical to perform a pressure test of a final closure weld that joins a new or replacement section of\n piping to an existing system, all the following requirements shall be satisfied. \na)The new or replacement piping section is pressure tested and examined in accordance with t heapplicable code governing the design of the piping system, or if not practical, welds are examined withappropriate NDE, as specified by the authorized piping inspector.\nb)The closure weld is a weld between any pipe or standard piping component of equal diameter a ndt\nhickness, axially aligned (not miter cut), and of equivalent materials. Where slip-on flanges or socketweld fittings are permitted by the specification for the piping system, they may be used within thelimitations of that specification. Acceptable alternatives are as follows:\n1)slip-on flanges for design cases up to Class 150 and 500 ¬∞F (260 ¬∞C);\n2)socket-welded fittings for sizes NPS 2 or less and design cases up to 500 ¬∞F (260 ¬∞C); a spacerdesigned for socket welding or some other means shall be used to establish a minimum 1/16 in.\n(1.6 mm) gap. Socket welds shall be per ASME B31.3 and shall be a minimum of two passes.\nc)Any final closure butt weld shall be examined by 100 % RT or by angle beam ultrasonic flaw detection,\nprovided the appropriate acceptance criteria have been established.\nd)MT or PT and shall be performed on the completed weld for butt and fillet welds.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nWhen angle beam ultrasonic methods are used, the owner-operator shall specify industry-qualified UT \nangle beam examiners for closure welds that have not been pressure tested and for weld repairs identified \nby the piping engineer or authorized piping inspector. \n8.3 Rerating \nRerating piping systems by changing the temperature rating or the MAWP may be done only after all the \nfollowing requirements have been met. \na)Calculations are performed by the piping engineer or the inspector.\nb)All reratings shall be established in accordance with the requirements of the code to which the pipin gsystem was built or by computation using the appropriate methods in the latest edition of the applicablecode or other industry standards approved by a standards development organization ( e.g. API 579-1/ASME FFS-1).\nc)Current inspection records verify that the piping system is satisfactory for the proposed serviceconditions and that the appropriate corrosion allowance is provided.\nd)Rerated piping systems shall be leak tested in accordance with the code to which the piping systemwas built or\n the latest edition of the applicable code for the new service conditions, unless one of t hef\nollowing is true.\n1)Documented records indicate that a previous leak test was performed at greater than or equal tothe test pressure for the new condition.\n2)The rerate is an increase in the rating temperature that does not affect allowable tensile stress.\n3)The piping integrity is confirmed by appropriate nondestructive inspection techniques in lieu oftesting after\n consultation with the inspector and piping engineer.\ne)The piping system is checked to affirm that the required PRDs are present, are set at the appropriatepressure, and have the appropriate capacity at set pressure.\nf)The piping system rerating is acceptable to the inspector or piping engineer.\ng)All piping components in the system (such as valves, flanges, bolts, gaskets, packing, and expansionjoints) are\n adequate for the new combination of pressure and temperature.\nh)Piping flexibility is adequate for design temperature changes.\ni)A decrease in minimum operating temperature is justified by impact test results, if required by t heapplicable code.\nReratings shall be documented, and appropriate engineering records updated.",

Authorization for alteration work to a piping system \nmay not be given without prior consultation with, and approval by, the piping engineer. The inspector will \ndesignate any inspection hold points required during the repair or alteration sequence. The inspector may \ngive prior general authorization for limited or routine repairs and procedures, provided the inspector is \nsatisfied with the competency of the repair organization. \n8.1.3 Approval \nAll proposed methods of design, execution, materials, welding procedures, examination, and testing shall \nbe approved by the inspector or by the piping engineer, as appropriate. Owner-operator approval of on-stream welding is required. \nWelding repairs of cracks that occurred in-service should not be attempted without prior consultation with \nthe piping engineer to identify and correct the cause of the cracking. Examples are cracks suspected of \nbeing caused by vibration, thermal cycling, thermal expansion problems, and environmental cracking. \nThe inspector shall approve all repair and alteration work at designated hold points and after the repairs and\n8.1.4 Welding Repairs (Including On-stream) \n8.1.4.1 Temporary Repairs \nFor temporary repairs, including on-stream, a full encirclement welded split sleeve or box-type enclosure \ndesigned by the piping engineer may be applied over the damaged or corroded area. See various articles in ASME PCC-2 for more information on repairs to piping systems. Longitudinal cracks shall not be repaired \nin this manner unless the piping engineer has determined that cracks would not be expected to propagate from under the sleeve. The design of temporary enclosures and repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer. \nIf the repair area is localized (for example, pitting or pinholes) and the SMYS of the pipe is not more than 40,000 psi (275,800 kPa), and a Fitness-For-Service analysis shows that it is acceptable, a temporary \nrepair may be made by fillet welding a properly designed split coupling or plate patch over the pitted or \nlocally thinned area. The material for the repair shall match the base metal unless approved by the piping \nengineer. A f illet-welded patch shall not be installed on top of an existing fillet-welded patch. When installing \na fillet-welded patch adjacent to an existing fillet-welded patch, the minimum distance between the toe of \nthe fillet weld shall not be less than: \n4d Rt=\nwhere \nd is the minimum distance between the toes of fillet welds of adjacent fillet weld attachments, in \ninches (millimeters); \nR is the inside radius in inches (millimeters); \nt is the minimum required thickness of the fillet-welded patch in inches (millimeters). \nFor minor leaks and thinning below tmin, properly designed enclosures may be welded over the leak or thin \npiping while the piping system is in-service, provided the inspector is satisfied that adequate thickness \nremains in the actual location of the proposed weld and heat-affected zone, and the piping component can \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n withstand welding without the likelihood of further material damage, such as from caustic service. Any leak in \na Class 1 service, or where a risk ranking is determined to be high, shall be first reviewed by a piping \nengineer to determine if the work can be safely performed while the system remains on stream. \nTemporary repairs should be removed and replaced with a suitable permanent repair at the next available \nmaintenance opportunity. Temporary repairs may remain in place for a longer period only if approved and \ndocumented by the piping engineer. \n8.1.4.2 Permanent Repairs \nRepairs to defects found in piping components may be made by preparing a welding groove that completely \nremoves the defect and then filling the groove with weld metal deposited in accordance with 8.2. \nCorroded areas may be restored with weld metal deposited in accordance with 8.2. Surface irregularities \nand contamination shall be removed before welding. Appropriate NDE methods shall be applied after \ncompletion of the weld. \nIf it is feasible to take the piping system out of service, the defective area may be removed by cutting out a \ncylindrical section and replacing it with a piping component that meets the applicable code. \nInsert patches (flush patches) may be used to repair damaged or corroded areas if the following \nrequirements are met: \na) full-penetration groove welds are provided; \nb) for Class 1 and Class 2 piping systems, the welds shall be 100 % radiographed or ultrasonically tested \nusing NDE procedures that are approved by the inspector; \nc) patches may be any shape but shall have rounded corners [1 in. (25 mm) minimum radius]. See ASME \nPCC-2 for more information on various welded repairs to piping systems. \n8.1.5 Nonwe lded Repairs (On-stream) \nTemporary repairs of locally thinned sections or circumferential linear defects may be made on-stream by \ninstalling a properly designed and applied enclosure ( e.g. bolted clamp, nonmetallic composite wrap, \nmetallic and epoxy wraps, or another nonwelded applied temporary repair). The design shall include control \nof axial thrust loads if the piping component being enclosed is (or may become) insufficient to control \npressure thrust. The effect of enclosing (crushing) forces on the component also shall be considered. See \nASME PCC-2 for more information on nonmetallic composite wrap repair methods. \nDuring turnarounds or other appropriate opportunities, temporary leak sealing and leak dissipating devices, \n(e.g. wire wrapping, mechanical clamps, etc.), including temporary repairs on valves, shall be removed and \nappropriate actions taken to restore the original integrity of the piping system. The inspector and/or piping \nengineer shall be involved in determining repair methods and procedures. Temporary leak sealing and leak \ndissipating devices may remain in place for a longer period only if approved and documented by the piping \nengineer. From a mechanical integrity perspective, injection fittings on valves to seal fugitive (LDAR) \nemissions from valve stem seal are not considered to be temporary repairs. Their removal or valve \nreplacement is at the discretion of the owner operator. \nProcedures that include leak sealing fluids (‚Äúpumping‚Äù) for process piping should be reviewed for acceptance by the\n inspector or piping engineer. The review should take into consideration the compatibility \nof the sealant with the leaking material; the pumping pressure on the clamp, especially when repumping, \nand any resulting crushing forces; the risk of sealant affecting downstream flow meters, PRDs, or \nmachinery; the risk of subsequent leakage at bolt threads causing corrosion or stress corrosion cracking of \nbol\nSin√≥nimos ES: reparaciones; alteraciones; rec√°lculo; rerating; soldadura; PWHT; hot tapping\nSynonyms EN: and rerating of piping systems api 570; piping inspection; and rerating of piping systems 4"

                "TEXT": "9.1 General \nInspection of buried process piping (not regulated by the Department of Transportation) is different from other process piping inspection because significant external deterioration can be caused by corrosive soil conditions and the inspection can be hindered by the inaccessibility of the affected areas of the piping. \nImportant, nonmandatory references for underground piping inspection are API 574, API 651, and the \nfollowing NACE documents: SP0102, SP0169, SP0274, and SP0502. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nBuried piping shall be inspected to determine its external surface condition or periodically leak tested per \nthe guidance given in 9.2.6. An inspection plan designed to address the unique challenges of these piping \nsections is required, and guidance can be found in API 574. \nThe inspection plans shall be based on an assessment of the effectiveness of protection systems and data \nobtained from one or more of the following methods: \na)an assessment of the performance of protection methods such as external coatings and cathodicprotection;\nb) above-ground visual surveillance results (see API 574);\nc)observations during maintenance activity on connecting piping of similar materials;\nd)representative portions of the actual piping;\ne)buried piping in similar service including burial conditions;\nf)permanently installed thickness monitoring devices;\ng)inspections conducted with in-line inspection devices;\nh)results of inspections above the pipe (e.g. direct current voltage gradient), local exposed areas\n(thickness surveys), or extended range (long-range UT) that provides data on condition and integrity\n(see API 574).\n9.2 Frequency and Extent of Inspection \n9.2.1 Above-grade V isual Surveillance \nThe owner-operator should, at approximately 6-month intervals, survey the surface conditions on and \nadjacent to each buried piping path (see API 574 for additional guidance on how to perform these actions). \n9.2.2 Pipe-to-Soil Potential Survey \nA close-interval potential survey on a line with cathodic protection may be used to verify that the buried \npiping has an acceptable protective potential throughout its length. For poorly coated pipes where cathodic \nprotection potentials are inconsistent, the survey may be conducted at 3-to-5-year intervals for verification \nof continuous corrosion control. \nFor piping with no cathodic protection or in areas where leaks have occurred due to external corrosion, a pipe-to-soil potential survey may be conducted along the pipe route. The pipe should be excavated for \ninspection or inspected with appropriate NDE at sites where possibilities of active corrosion cells have been located to determine the extent of corrosion damage. A continuous potential profile or a close-interval survey may be required to better locate active corrosion cells. See API 574 for additional guidance on how \nto perform these actions. \n9.2.3 Pipe Coating Holiday Survey \nThe frequency of pipe coating holiday surveys is usually based on indications that other forms of corrosion \ncontrol are ineffective. For example, on a coated pipe where there is gradual loss of cathodic protection \npotentials or an external corrosion leak occurs at a coating defect, a pipe coating holiday survey may be used to evaluate the coating. See API 574 for additional guidance on when and how to perform these \nactions. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n 9.2.4 Soil Corrosivity \nFor piping buried in lengths greater than 100 ft (30 m) and not cathodically protected, evaluations of soil \ncorrosivity should be performed at appropriate intervals based on likelihood of change. Soil resistivity measurements may be used for relative class ification of the soil corrosivity (see 9.5). Additional factors that \nmay warrant consideration are changes in soil chemistry and analyses of the polarization resistance of the soil and piping interface. See API 574 for guidance on how to perform these acti ons. \n9.2.5 External and Internal Inspection Intervals \nIf internal corrosion of buried piping is expected because of inspection on the above-grade portion of the \nline, inspection intervals and methods for the buried portion should be adjusted accordingly. The inspector should be aware of and consider the possibility of accelerated internal corrosion in deadlegs. \nThe external condition of buried piping that is not cathodically protected should be determined by either inline inspection, which can measure wall thickness, or by excavating according to the frequency given in \nTable 4. Significant external corrosion detected by in-line inspection or by other means may require \nexcavation and evaluation even if the piping is cathodically protected. \nPiping inspected periodically by excavation shall be inspected in lengths of 6 ft to 8 ft (2.0 m to 2.5 m) at \none or more locations judged to be most susceptible to corrosion. Excavated piping should be inspected \nfull circumference for the type and extent of corrosion (pitting or general) and the condition of the coating. \nIf inspection reveals damaged coating or corroded piping, additional piping shall be excavated until the \nextent of the condition is identified. If the average wall thickness is at or below the minimum required \nthickness, it shall be repaired or replaced. \nIf the piping is contained inside a casing pipe, the condition of the casing should be inspected to determine if water and/or soil has entered the casing. The inspector should verify the following: \na) both ends of the casing extend beyond the soil surface; \nb) the ends of the casing are sealed if the casing is not self-draining; \nc) the pressure-carrying pipe is properly coated and wrapped; \nd) there is no metallic or electrolytic contact between the casing and the pressure carrying pipe. \n9.2.6 Leak Testing Intervals \nAn alternative or supplement to inspection is leak testing with liquid at a pressure at least 10 % greater than maximum operating pressure at intervals one-half the length of those shown in Table 4 for piping not \ncathodically protected and at the same intervals as shown in Table 4 for cathodically protected piping. The \nleak test should be maintained for a period of 8 hours. Four hours after the initial pressurization of the piping \nsystem, the pressure should be noted and, if necessary, the line repressurized to original test pressure and \nisolated from the pressure source. If, during the remainder of the test period, the pressure decreases more \nthan 5 %, the piping should be visually inspected externally and/or inspected internally to find the leak and assess the extent of corrosion. Sonic measurements may be helpful in locating leaks during leak testing. \nBuried piping also may be surveyed for integrity by using temperature-corrected volumetric or pressure test \nmethods. Other alternative leak test methods involve acoustic emission examination and the addition of a tracer fluid to the pressurized line (such as helium or sulfur hexafluoride). If the tracer is added to the service \nfluid, the owner-operator shall confirm suitability for process and product. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nTable 4‚ÄîFrequency of Inspection or Alternate Leak Testing for Buried Piping without Effective \nCathodic Protection \nSoil Resistivity \n(ohm-cm) Inspection Interval \n(years) Alternate Pressure Test \nInterval with Effective \nCathodic Protection \n(years) Alternate Pressure Test \nInterval without Effective \nCathodic Protection \n(years) \n< 2000 5 5 2.5 \n2000‚Äì 10,000 10 10 5 \n> 10,000 15 15 7.5 \n9.3 Repairs to Buried Piping Systems \n9.3.1 Repairs to Coatings \nAny coating removed for inspection shall be renewed and inspected appropriately (preferably by a NACE \ncertified coating inspector). For coating repairs, the inspector should be assured that the coating meets the \nfollowing criteria: \na)it has sufficient adhesion to the pipe to prevent under-film migration of moisture;\nb)it is sufficiently ductile to resist cracking;\nc)it is free of voids and gaps in the coating (holidays);\nd)it has sufficient strength to resist damage due to handling and soil stress;\ne)it can support any supplemental cathodic protection.\nIn addition, coating repairs may be tested using a high-voltage holiday detector. The detector voltage shall \nbe adjusted to the appropriate value for the coating material and thickness. Any holidays found shall be \nrepaired and retested. \n9.3.2 Clamp Repairs \nIn general, bolted clamps should be avoided for temporary repairs to all buried piping. If piping leaks are clamped and reburied, the location of the clamp shall be logged in the inspection record and may be surface marked. Both the marker and the record shall note the date of installation and the location of the clamp. All \nclamps shall be considered temporary. Temporary repairs on buried piping should be permanently repaired \nat the next maintenance opportunity unless approved for extension by a piping engi neer. \n9.3.3 Welded Repairs \nWelded repairs shall be made in accordance with 8.2. \n9.4 Records \nRecord systems for buried piping should be maintained in accordance with 7.9. In addition, a record of the \nlocation and date of installation of temporary clamps shall be maintained. Also, buried piping should be \nlocated on a drawing (i.e. plot plan or piping iso) indicating size and external corrosion mitigation. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n76 Annex A \n(normative) \n \nInspector Certification \nA.1 Examination \nInspector Certification Exam Body of Knowledge as published by API. \nTo become an authorized API piping inspector, candidates must pass the examination. \nA.2 Certification \nTo qualify for the certification examination, the applicant‚Äô s education and experience, when combined, shall \nbe equal to at least one of the following: \na) a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering or technology, or 2 years of military service in a technical \nrole (dishonorable discharge disqualifies credit), plus 1 year of experience in supervision of inspection \nb) a 2-year degree or certificate in engineering or technology, or 3 or more years of military service in a \ntechnical role (dishonorable discharge disqualifies credit), plus 2 years of experience in the design, \nfabrication, repair, inspection, or operation of piping systems, of which 1 year shall be in supervision of \nc) a high school diploma or equivalent, plus 3 years of experience in the design, fabrication, repair, \ninspection, or operation of piping systems, of which 1 year shall be in supervision of inspection activities \nd) a minimum of 5 years of experience in the design, fabrication, repair, inspection, or operation of piping \nsystems, of which 1 year shall be in supervision of inspection activities or performance of inspection \nA.3 Recertification \ninspector certificat ion.

Such a classification system allows extra inspection efforts to be focused on piping \nsystems that may have the highest potential consequences if failure or loss of containment should occur. \nIn general, the higher classified systems require more extensive inspection at shorter intervals to affirm \ntheir integrity for continued safe operation. Classifications should be based on potential safety and \nenvironmental effects should a leak occur. When pipe service conditions change, pipe classifications and \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nnspection plans should be reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect the changed operating conditions \n(e.g. a hydrocarbon service temperature increase that might change from ‚Äúslowly vaporizing during a \nrelease‚Äù to ‚Äúrapidly vaporizing during a release‚Äù). \nOwner-operator shall maintain a record of process piping fluids handled, including their classifications. \nNFPA 704 provides information that may be helpful in classifying piping systems according to the potential \nhazards of the process fluids they contain. \nNOT E The operating temperature of a hydrocarbon stream relative to its flash point, boiling point, and autoignition \ntemperature is a significant factor in defining potential consequence of a release. Operating temperature of hydrocarbon \npiping systems should be considered when assigning piping service class. For example, on-site ambient temperature \ngaso line is Class 2 because it is below the boiling point but above the flash point of gasoline. However, on-site gasoline \nat 550 ¬∞F should be Class 1 since autoignition can occur. \nThe four classes listed below in 6.3.4.2 through 6.3.4.5 are recommended. \n6.3.4.2 Class 1 \nServices with the highest potential of resulting in an immediate emergency if a leak were to occur are in \nClass 1. Such an emergency may be safety or environmental in nature. Examples of Class 1 piping include, \nbut are not necessarily limited to, those containing the following: \na)flammable services that can autorefrigerate and lead to brittle fracture;\nb) pre ssurized services that can rapidly vaporize during release, creating vapors that can collect and forman explosive mixture, such as C2, C3, and C4 streams; f luids that can rapidly vaporize are those withatmospheric boiling temperatures below 50 ¬∞F (10 ¬∞C) or where the atmospheric boiling point is belowthe operating temperature (typically a concern with high-temperature services);\nc)hydrog en sulfide (greater than 3 % weight) in a gaseous stream;\nd) anh ydrous hydrogen chloride;\ne)HF acid (e.g. in HF alkylation units, as discussed in API 751, etc.);\nf)pipin g over or adjacent to water and piping over public throughways (refer to national or local regulations\n[e.g. the Department of Transportation and Coast Guard] for inspection of over water piping);\ng)flammable services operating above their autoignition temperature.\n6.3.4.3 Class 2 \nServices not included in other classes are in Class 2. This classification includes most of the unit process \npiping and selected off-site piping. Typical examples of these services include but are not necessarily \nlimited to those containing the following: \na) on-site hydrocarbons that will slowly vaporize during release, such as those operating below the boilin gpoint but above the flash point;\nb) on-site hydrogen, fuel gas, and natural gas;\nc)on-site strong acids and caustics.\n6.3.4.4 Class 3 \nServices that are either flammable but do not significantly vaporize when they leak, i.e. below the flash \npoint, or flammable but are in remote areas and operate below the boiling point are in Class 3. Services \nthat are potentially harmful to human tissue but are in remote areas may be included in this class. Examples \nof Class 3 service include, but are not necessarily limited to, those containing the following: \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\na) on-site hydrocarbons that will not significantly vaporize during release such as those operating belowthe flash point;\nb)off-site distillate and product lines to and from storage and loading;\nc)tank farm piping;\nd)off-site acids and caustics;\ne)off-site hydrogen, fuel gas, and natural gas;\nf)other lower risk hydrocarbon piping that does not fall in Class 1, 2, or 4.\n6.3.4.5 Class 4 \nServices that are essentially nonflammable and nontoxic are in Class 4, as are most utility services. \nInspection of Class 4 piping is optional and usually based on reliability needs and business impacts as \nopposed to safety or environmental impact. Examples of Class 4 service include, but are not necessarily \nlimited to, those containing the following: \na)steam and steam condensate;\nb)air;\nc)nitrogen;\nd)water, including boiler feed water or stripped sour water;\ne)lube oil and seal oil;\nf)ASME B31.3, Category D services;\ng)plumbing and sewers.\n6.4 Extent of Visual External and CUI Inspections \nExternal visual inspections, including inspections for CUI, should be conducted in accordance with 6.3.3. \nAlternatively, external visual inspection intervals or due dates can be established by using a valid RBI \nassessment conducted in accordance with API 580. This external visual inspection for potential CUI is also \nto assess insulation condition and shall be conducted on all piping systems susceptible to CUI. The results \nof the visual inspection should be documented to facilitate follow-up inspections. \nFollowing the external visual inspection of susceptible systems, additional examination is required for the inspection\n of CUI. The extent and type of the additional CUI inspection are listed in Table 2. Damaged \ninsulation at higher elevations may result in CUI in lower areas remote from the damage. NDE inspection \nfor CUI should also be conducted as listed in Table 2 at suspect locations operating between 10 ¬∞F ( ‚àí12 ¬∞C) \nand 350 ¬∞F (175 ¬∞C) for carbon steel and low-alloy steel piping. Piping that may be determined to not fall \nwithin this range but may cycle in and out of the range or may be susceptible to CUI during shutdowns and \nshould be considered. RT or insulation removal and visual inspection is normally required for this inspection \nat damaged or suspect locations. Other NDE assessment methods may be used where applicable. If the \ninspection of the damaged or suspect areas has located significant CUI, additional areas should be \ninspected and, where warranted, up to 100 % of the circuit should be inspected. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nTable 2‚Äî Recommended Extent of CUI Inspection Following Visual Inspection for Susceptible \nPiping aPipe Class At Damaged Insulation Locations At Nondamaged Locations \n(No Visual Damage Identified d uring Visual \nExamination) \nApproximate Amount of Examination \nwith NDE or Insulation Removal at Areas \nwith Damaged Insulation Approximate Amount of CUI Inspection with \nNDE or Insulation Removal at Areas without \nDamaged Insulation b \n1 75 % 50 % \n2 50 % 33 % \n3 25 % 10 % \n4 Optional Optional \na Susceptible piping is piping systems operating within the susceptible temperature ranges as indicated in API 574. \nb The third column are additional areas to consider inspecting and not progressive from the second column. \nThe extent of the CUI program described in Table 2 should be considered as target levels for piping systems \nand locations with no CUI inspection experience. It is recognized that several factors may affect the \nlikelihood of CUI to include the following: \na)local climatic conditions;\nb)insulation design and maintenance;\nc)coating quality;\nd)service conditions.\nFacilities with CUI inspection experience may increase or reduce the CUI inspection targets of Table 2. An exact\n accounting of the CUI inspection targets is not required. The owner-operator may confirm inspection \ntargets with operational history or other documentation. \nPiping systems that are known to have a remaining life of over 10 years or that are adequately protected \nagainst external corrosion need not be included for the NDE inspection recommended in Table 2. However, \nthe condition of the insulating system or the outer jacketing, such as a cold-box shell, should be observed \nperiodically by operating or other personnel. If deterioration is noted, it should be reported to the inspector. \nThe following are examples of these systems: \na)piping systems insulated effectively to preclude the entrance of moisture;\nb)jacketed cryogenic piping systems;\nc)piping systems installed in a cold box in which the atmosphere is purged with an inert gas;\nd)piping systems in which the temperature being maintained is sufficiently low or sufficiently high topreclude the presence of water.\nThe external visual inspection on bare piping is to assess the condition of paint and coating systems, to check for\n external corrosion, and to check for other forms of deterioration. \n6.5 Extent of Thickness Measurement Inspection and Data Analysis \n6.5.1 CML Monitoring \nTo satisfy inspection interval requirements, each thickness measurement inspection should obtain thickness \nreadings on a representative sampling of the total number of CMLs on each circuit (see 5.6).

Where localized damage mechanisms are \nidentified, sampling should also include the location and orientation (top/bottom, inside/outside radius, etc.) \nwhere the damage is most likely to occur. The number and specific CMLs to be monitored at each inspection \nshall be determined by the inspector in consultation with a piping engineer and/or corrosion specialist where \nnonuniform corrosion or other damage mechanisms are expected. Therefore, scheduled inspection of circuits \nshould obtain as many measurements as necessary to satisfactorily monitor the type and extent of damage \nanticipated in each piping system. If RBI is used to set the inspection interval or due date, CMLs not required \nfor inspection per the RBI assessment do not need to be inspected in accordance with the recommended \nmaximum inspection intervals in Table 1. \nTo determine the extent of thickness measurements necessary to develop a corrosion rate and remaining \nlife, two basic approaches are acceptable as discussed below. \n6.5.2 Point-to-Point Method \nThis analysis method is where the corrosion rate, remaining life, and reinspection interval are determined \nfor each individual CML without adjustment for the results of other CML measurements in the circuit. Future \ninspections are managed based on the 1/2 life established at each CML location. During a reinspection of a \npiping system, all the CMLs may be reinspected or only those that are coming due. This method can lead \nto frequent inspections of the same piping system if not carefully managed. It is generally not possible to apply \na statistical analysis with the point-to-point method since 1) a relationship of one CML to another has not been \nestablished, making it difficult to compare corrosion rates in the circuit or between CMLs, and 2) the individual \nCML rates may be generated over significantly different time periods, when operating conditions may have \nchanged. \n6.5.3 Circuit Analysis Method \nWhere piping has been circuitized into common corrosion mechanisms and expected rates, a statistical analysis \nmay be used to determine the appropriate number of representative sample points, a representative circuit \ncorrosion rate, and the inspection interval. There are a number of considerations for using a statistical analysis \napproach that are necessary to remain appropriately conservative, some of which include the following. \na)Approach is generally applicable to damage mechanisms that produce uniform corrosion. However,\nwhen considering localized corrosion, the approach must be constructed for proper application.\nb)Locations that exhibit significantly different corrosion rates and locations with shorter remaining life mayneed to\n be analyzed separately and/or moved to separate circuits.\nc)A sampling statistic should be considered to check the statistical confidence factor given the variabilityof the data\n set (within a circuit).\nd)The number of data points (CMLs) may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired statistical confidencebefore\n employing a statistical methodology.\ne)A safety factor or confidence interval, which may be dependent on the expected damage mechanismsand may additionally account for circuit complexity, should be considered to account for uncertaintiessuch as measurement error and overall failure risk.\nf)CML reinspection shall not be extended beyond the date projected to reach the established minimumrequired thickness. Absolute limits should be considered for reinspection of CMLs based on thelikelihood of failure (e.g. time or thickness limit).\ng)Depending on the statistical analysis method used, the data population should be tested to make sur et meets the criteria for the distribution type utilized in the analysis.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nAs a minimum, the worst-case CMLs (those that are driving the need for the next inspection (e.g. those \nwith the highest corrosion rate and/or the lowest remaining corrosion allowance) within the circuit shall be \ninspected at the next established inspection interval. \n6.5.4 Data Analysis \nSome level of data analysis is recommended under both approaches discussed above. Since the calculated \ncorrosion rate used to predict the future remaining life was a product of the prior operating history, it is \nimportant to check for any acceleration of the corrosion rate over time and to be aware of planned \noperational changes. Good quality MOC and IOW programs are beneficial where critical process variables \nthat may affect corrosion/damage rate or susceptibility are tracked. Additional data analysis should consider \nthe following. \na)Is the measured rate within the expected/predicted range?\nb)Is the short rate significantly different from the long rate?\nc)Has the variability (or standard deviation) within the circuit data increased significantly over time?\nd) Do components, orientations, sections within the circuit, or other identifiable features of the circuitexhibit significantly different rates?\ne)Have data anomalies been resolved, either through a review process or verification readings, prior t odata analysis?\nf)Has the impact on results from measurement error in the technique used been incorporated?\nIn general, both approaches should be developed considering the potential active damage mechanisms \nwithin the piping system. Representative CMLs should be primarily based on the locations where the \ndamage mechanisms are likely to be most active but should also include a sampling of all sizes, \norientations, component types, and design features ( e.g. control valve stations, equipment inlets/outlets, \nand alternate flow piping) within the line or circuit. This sampling also shall include CMLs with the earliest \nrenewal date as of the previous inspection. \nFor general corrosion, it may not be necessary to identify the specific orientation of the examination point. \nWhere localized damage mechanisms are expected, sampling should include the orientation (top/bottom, \ninside/outside radius, etc.) to help identify the specific active mechanism and provide data for future \nadjustments to CML locations. \nStatistical tools may be used to determine or adjust the CML quantities when prior data are available. For \nnew circuits or those with a change in-service, data from a similar service may be applied to estimate CML \nquantities and/or locations. Circuit inspections should include as many measurements as necessary to \nsatisfactorily monitor the type and extent of damage anticipated in each piping system. CMLs that are not \ndriving the next inspection interval do not necessarily need to be inspected in accordance with the \nrecommended maximum inspection intervals in Table 1. If a circuit statistical analysis method is to be \nperformed, a representative sampling of all CMLs should be taken to avoid skewing the data. \nRepresentative sampling is not an important consideration using the point-to-point method. \nIn addition, some CMLs may be documented as ‚Äúinactive‚Äù or ‚Äúarchived. ‚Äù These are CML points that have \nessentially been eliminated from the active registry but are being maintained for historical record purposes. \nThere are several reasons to consider inactivating or archiving CMLs, including inappropriate placement of \nCML, sufficient coverage by other CMLs, lack of historical corrosion activity, etc. Although these CMLs may \nbe maintained within the system (or electronic IDMS), they do not need to be measured on calculated \nintervals and would not be considered as overdue. \n6.5.5 Review and Verification of Thickness Data Accuracy \nEach owner-operator should have a procedure in place to provide for a review and/or verification of \nthickness data accuracy when data errors/anomalies are suspected. Such a procedure will reduce the \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n chances for thickness data anomalies being used in the process of calculating short and LT corrosion rates, \nwhich in turn could affect the scheduled inspection interval and remaining life calculation. To help reduce \ninaccuracies in thickness data taking, examiners should have training and procedures that address the 10 \nfactors included in 5.7.1 that can contribute to reduced accuracy of ultrasonic thickness measurements. \nWhen thickness data measure errors/anomalies are suspected ( e.g. thickness growths or losses of 10 % \nor more), then implementation of a data verification process may be warranted. Such a procedure/work \nprocess may include validation of the questionable measurements with: \na) additional thickness measurements being repeated at the CML(s) in question; \nb) use of another trained NDE technician or inspector to take the validation readings; \nc) use of a different, calibrated thickness measuring device to take the validation readings; \nd) review and corrective action implemented for any of the other applicable factors listed in 5.7.1 that may \nhave been a factor in the questionable readings. \nWhen questionable thickness measurements have been validated, inspection records should be updated \nto note that the reading(s) has been validated and/or changed and which reading should be used in the succeeding data analysis. \n6.6 Extent of Inspections on SBP, Deadlegs, Auxiliary Piping, and Threaded Connections \n6.6.1 SBP \nSBP that is primary process piping shall be inspected in accordance with all the requirements of this \ndocument. As with larger diameter piping, inspection practices for SBP shall have inspection plans based \nupon credible damage mechanisms in API 571 other than just wall thinning ( e.g. stress corrosion cracking, \nhydrogen-induced cracking, embrittlement, etc.). Specific attention should be paid to damage that may have \nbeen inflicted by mechanical overloading on SBP since the strength and support systems for SBP are \nsometimes not adequate to avoid overload ( e.g. vents, drains, and bridles). \nWhere RBI is not in use, SBP that is secondary process piping has different minimum requirements \ndepending upon service classification. Class 1 and Class 2 secondary SBP shall be inspected to the same \nrequirements as primary process piping. Inspection of Class 3 and Class 4 secondary SBP is optional at \nthe owner-operator ‚Äôs discretion depending upon reliability and risk. \nInsulated SBP should receive the same inspection practices for CUI as the primary piping or vessels to \nwhich it is attached. Insulation stripping and RT are the preferred inspection methods for insulated SBP. \nAttention should be paid to insulation system resealing on SBP. \nReference API 574 for multiple design, fabrication, installation, and operating issues that can affect the \nlikelihood of failure for SBP systems. \n6.6.2 Deadleg Inspection \nDeadlegs, including both large-bore piping and SBP (e.g. level bridles), can be areas of increased corrosion \nrequiring special attention if they are deemed potentially corrosive by a corrosion specialist because of the \naccumulation of contaminated water, solid materials, different temperatures from the main line, or the \naccumulation or concentration of corrosive species ( e.g. ammonium salts, organic acids, hydrogen sulfide, \nand acidic deposits). Risk assessment can be useful in determining which piping system deadlegs may be \na higher threat to accelerated corrosion than active piping circuits. Deadlegs that are part of primary piping \nsystems should be considered at greater risk because of the inability to valve them off in the event of a leak \nand the higher potential consequence of a large leak. \nConsideration should be given to coordinating with operations to identify and remove potentially corrosive \ndeadlegs that are deemed nonessential in order to reduce risk and inspection workload. Corrosion \nspecialists should be consulted for placement of CMLs on deadlegs because of their potential for localized corrosion, especially about accelerated corrosion above and below liquid interfaces. Infrared thermography \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nay be useful for locating liquid interfaces in deadlegs. Inspections of horizontal deadlegs that may not be \nliquid full should have examination points in all four quadrants of any CMLs. \nPotentially corrosive deadlegs with CMLs should be tracked in a separate piping circuit from the mainline \npiping. These deadlegs or low points are typically identified and documented in the inspection records and \non inspection ISOs. Deadlegs may be combined into the primary piping circuit if their anticipated damage \nmechanisms and corrosion rates are similar. Inspections should include profile RT on small diameter \ndeadlegs (less than or equal to 8‚Äù), such as vents and drains, and scanning UT or RT on larger diameter \ndeadlegs. Other examination techniques for deadlegs include EMAT and PEC. Profile RT should be \nemployed for deadlegs that may be susceptible to fouling deposits that could cause under deposit corrosion \nor other integrity problems ( e.g. fouling in relief lines). \nDeadlegs that may collect water and be susceptible to freezing from external ambient conditions should be \nadequately insulated and heat traced for such cases. \nNOTE Deadleg areas of a hot piping system that was defined as outside the CUI range can potentially be operating \nwithin the CUI temperature range or be exposed to CUI during downtime. When this is identified, then guidance related \nto CUI inspection from 6.4 should be applied. \nSome examples include blanked (blinded) branches, lines with normally closed block valves, lines with one \nend blanked, pressurized dummy support legs, stagnant control valve bypass piping, spare pump piping, \nlevel bridles, PRD inlet and outlet header piping, pump trim bypass lines, high-point vents, sample points, \ndrains, bleeders, and instrument connections. Deadlegs also include piping that is no longer in use but still \nconnected to the process. \n6.6.3 Auxiliary Piping Inspection \nInspection of auxiliary SBP associated with instruments and machinery is typically to be determined by risk \nassessment, including impacts on process safety and reliability. Criteria to consider in determining whether \nauxiliary SBP will need some form of inspection include the following: \na) piping classification;\nb)potential for environmental or fatigue cracking, particularly on nonbraced SBP ( e.g. reciprocating andentrifugal compressors, flow-induced vibration);\nc)potential for corrosion based on experience with adjacent primary systems (especially since auxiliarySBP thickness will be thinner and likely results in full penetration corrosion sooner than in the primarypipe);\nd)potential for CUI;\nNOTE See CUI inspection section for special requirements on auxiliary piping. Auxiliary piping systems canpotentially be operating within the CUI range even though the primary piping system operates outside the CUItemperature range.\ne)potential for fatigue and erosion and/or corrosion on thermowells.\n6.6.4 Threaded-connection Inspection and MitigationInspection of threaded connections should be according to the requirements listed above for small-bore \nand auxiliary piping. RT is an effective inspection method for these connections, which can help identify \nlocalized corrosion in the annular space between the threads and the amount of thread engagement and \nidentify uniform wall loss from corrosion. \nSBP connections associated with rotating equipment, especially threaded connections, are often subject to \nfatigue damage. Due to the nature of fatigue damage and its rapid progression from crack initiation to final \nfracture, inspection is not a primary method for failure mitigation. Fatigue failures are best prevented \nthrough proper design of the joint or branch connection, such as eliminating exposed threads by covering \nthe threads with a seal weld/‚Äúbridge‚Äù weld, reducing or eliminating any overhanging wei ght, or providing \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\ntwo-plane gussets to the small-bore branch connections. When seal-welding threaded connections, pay \nclose attention to weld prep cleanliness to avoid welding defects and cover all threads completely. \nSBP in known vibratory service should be periodically assessed and considered for possible renewal with \na thicker wall or upgrading joint design. The need for such renewal will depend on the potential risk of \nfailure, including the following: \na)classification of piping;\nb)magnitude and frequency of vibration;\nc)amount of unsupported weight;\nd)current piping wall thickness;\ne)whether or not the system can be maintained on-stream;\nf)corrosion rate;\ng)intermittent service.\n6.7 Inspection and Maintenance of PRDs\n6.7.1 GeneralPRDs shall be inspected, tested, maintained, and repaired in accordance with this document and API 576. \nRepairs and maintenance shall be conducted by a repair organization qualified and experienced in PRD \nmaintenance per definition in 3.1.9 2. \n6.7.2 Quality Assurance Process for PRDs \nEach PRD repair organization shall have a fully documented quality assurance system. As a minimum, the \nfollowing shall be included in the quality assurance manual: \na)title page;\nb) revision log;\nd)statement of authority and responsibility;\ne) organizational chart;\nf)scope of work;\ng)drawings and specification controls;\nh)requirements for material and part control;\ni)repair and inspection program;\nj)requirements for welding, NDE, and heat treatment;\nk)requirements for valve testing, setting, leak testing, and sealing;\nl)general example of the valve repair nameplate;\nm)requirements for calibrating measurement and test gauges;\nn)requirements for updating and controlling copies of the quality control manual;\no) sample forms;\np)training and qualifications required for repair personnel;\nq)requirements for handling of non-conformances.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nEach repair organization shall also have a documented training program that shall verify that repair \npersonnel are qualified within the scope of the repairs they will be conducting. \n6.7.3 PRD Testing and Inspection Intervals \n6.7.3.1 General \nPRDs shall be tested and inspected at intervals that are frequent enough to verify that the valves perform \nreliably in the service conditions. Other PRDs (e.g. rupture disks and vacuum-breaker valves) shall be \ninspected at intervals based on service conditions. The inspection interval for all PRDs is determined by \nthe inspector, engineer, or other qualified individual per the owner-operators quality assurance system. \n6.7.3.2 PRD Testing and Inspection Intervals \nUnless documented experience and/or an RBI assessment indicates that a longer interval is acceptable, \ntest and inspection intervals for PRDs in typical process services should not exceed: \na)5 years for typical process services;\nb)10 years for clean (nonfouling) and noncorrosive services.\n6.7.3.3 As-received Condition, Testing, and Actions \nWherever possible, as-received relief ( pop) testing should be conducted prior to cleaning to yield accurate \nas-received pop testing results that will help establish/justify the appropriate inspection and servicing \ninterval. \nCleaning of deposits prior to as-received relief ( pop) testing can remove deposits that would have prevented \nthe valve from opening at set pressure. Refer to API 576 for more information on as-received pop testing \nand cleaning with adjacent piping. \nNOTE In some services, such as HF acid alkylation units, care needs to be taken to ensure safe handling and \nprotection of personnel (refer to API 576 for further guidance). \nWhen a PRD is found to be heavily fouled or stuck, or when a PRD fails an as-received relief ( pop) test, \nthe inspection and testing interval shall be reevaluated to determine if the interval should be shortened or \nother corrective action taken. The owner-operator should define the criteria that constitute an ‚Äú as-received‚Äù \nrelief ( pop) test failure. The owner-operator may define criteria for failure based on as-received relief ( pop) \ntest pressure as a percentage of cold differential set pressure. Unless specified by the owner-operator, a \npressure relief device is considered stuck when it has not relieved ( popped) at 150 % of its set pressure. \nAn investigation consistent with the principles documented in API 585 should be undertaken to determine \nthe cause of the fouling or the reasons for the PRD not operating properly. Refer to API 576 for additional \ninformation on PRD relief ( pop) test results and investigations. \n7 Inspection Data Evaluation, Analysis, and Recording \n7.1 Corrosion Rate Determination \n7.1.1 General \nThe owner-operator may use either the point-to-point analysis method or a statistical analysis method, or a \ncombination of both, to determine the LT or short-term (ST) corrosion rates. \n7.1.2 Point-to-Point Method \nThe LT corrosion rate of an individual CML shall be calculated from the following formula: \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\ninitial actualCorrosion rate (LT) time (years) between and initial actualtttt‚àí=\nThe ST corrosion rate of an individual CML shall be calculated from the following formula: \nprevious actualCorrosion rate (ST) time (years) between and previous actualtttt‚àí\n=\nwhere \ntinitial is the thickness, in inches (millimeters), at the same location as tactual measured at initial \ninstallation or at the commencement of a new corrosion rate environment; \ntprevious is the thickness, in inches (millimeters), at the same location as tactual measured during one or more previous inspections. \nLT and ST corrosion rates should be compared to see which results in the shortest remaining life as part \nof the data assessment. The authorized inspector, in consultation with a corrosion specialist, shall select \nthe corrosion rate that best reflects the current process (see 6.3.3 for inspection interval determination). \nMeasurement error exists in all systems and should be well defined or understood and where possible \ncontained in narrow error bands. This is particularly important in ST corrosion rate use where the error bands may result in misleading decisions. \nThe inspector should consult with a corrosion specialist when the ST corrosion rate changes from the \nanticipated or previously identified rate to determine the cause (see API 574 for wider guidance). \nAppropriate responses to accelerated corrosion rates may include the following: \na)obtaining additional UT thickness readings;\nb)using profile RT in lieu of, or to supplement UT readings;\nc)performing UT scans in suspect areas;\nd)performing other corrosion/process monitoring;\ne)reviewing changes in operations/process;\nf)revising the piping inspection plan;\ng)addressing non-conformances.\nCircuit corrosion rates should be estimated based on the anticipated damage mechanisms and operating \nconditions with a tolerance or range identified. Measured rates exceeding the established range signal the \nneed to review the potential causes and adjust the inspection plan. \n7.1.3 Statistical Analysis Method \nThe owner-operator may elect to use a statistical analysis method (e.g. probability plots or related tools) to \nestablish a representative corrosion, remaining life estimate, and/or reinspection date. Any statistical \napproach shall be documented. The statistical treatment of data should be based on representation of the \nvarious pipe components within the circuit. Statistical analysis employing point measurements is not applicable to piping circuits with significant localized unpredictable corrosion mechanisms ( see additional \nnotes and statistical analysis in 6.5.3). There are many statistical tools that can be employed once piping \ncircuits have been properly established. While such calculations offer a convenient means to numerically \nsummarize circuit data, it is often the combination of descriptive statistics plus data visualization through \nstatistical plots that provide the most useful results. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nSee API 574 for additional discussion on statistical analysis methods. \n7.2 Remaining Life Calculations \nThe remaining life shall be calculated from the following formula: \nactual requiredRemaining life (years) corrosion rate [inches (mm) per year]tt ‚àí\n=\nwhere \ntactual is the actual thickness, in inches (millimeters), measured at the time of inspection for a \ngiven location or component as specified in 5.7. \ntrequired is the required thickness, in inches (millimeters), at the same location or component as \nthe actual measurement computed by the design formulas ( e.g. pressure and structural) \nbefore corrosion allowance and manufacturer‚Äôs tolerance are added. \n7.3 Newly Installed Piping Systems or Changes in Service \nFor a new piping system/circuit or for a piping system/circuit for which service conditions are being changed, \none of the following methods shall be used to determine piping system/circuits probable corrosion rate. The remaining life and inspection interval can be determined from this rate. \na)A corrosion rate may be calculated from data collected by the owner-operator on piping operating inthe same or similar service.\nb)A corrosion rate may be determined through appropriately placed ultrasonic sensors on the piping.\nc)A corrosion rate may be estimated by a corrosion specialist.\nd)A corrosion rate may be estimated from published data on piping in same or similar service.\nIf the probable corrosion rate cannot be determined by either method listed under a) or d) above, the initial \nthickness measurement should be established at appropriate intervals until a credible corrosion rate is \nestablished. Corrosion monitoring devices, such as corrosion coupons or corrosion probes, may be useful \nin establishing the timing of direct measurements. Subsequent measurements need to be established on \nappropriate intervals until the corrosion rate is established. If it is later determined that an inaccurate \ncorrosion rate was assumed, the corrosion rate in the remaining life calculations shall be amended to reflect the actual corrosion rate. \nIn a case where items listed a) through d) cannot be applied with confidence and to en sure that an \nunexpected, accelerated corrosion rate does not occur unidentified, the inspection plan shall include determining wall loss change rate on-stream by direct measurement techniques after 6 months of service. \nThis may not determine an actual corrosion rate (because of potential measurement error) but ensuring that data are available to direct the inspection plan until a corrosion rate can be established. This is provided \nas a cautionary guideline due to the statistical variation in thickness readings taken in short interval, which \nmay suggest a corrosion rate that is not truly indicative of the environment. \n7.4 Existing and Replacement Piping \nCorrosion rates shall be calculated using one of the methods identified in 7.1. For repaired or in-kind \nreplacement piping, the corrosion rate shall be established based on the previous worst-case measured \nrate at the replacement location or the circuit average rate. \nIf calculations indicate that an inaccurate rate of corrosion has been assumed, the rate to be used for the next period shall be adjusted to agree with the actual rate found. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7.5 MAWP Determination \nThe MAWP for the continued use of piping systems shall be established using the applicable code. \nComputations may be made for known materials if all the following essential details are known to comply \nwith the principles of the applicable code: \na)upper and/or lower temperature limits for specific materials;\nb)quality of materials and workmanship;\nc)inspection requirements;\nd)reinforcement of openings;\ne)any cyclical service requirements.\nFor unknown materials, computations may be made assuming the lowest-grade material and joint efficiency \nin the applicable code. When the MAWP is recalculated, the wall thickness used in these computations shall be the actual thickness as determined by inspection minus twice the estimated corrosion loss before the date of the next inspection (see 6.3.3). Allowance shall be made for the other loadings in accordance \nwith the applicable code. The applicable code allowances for pressure and temperature variations from the \nMAWP are permitted provided all the associated code criteria are satisfied. \nAnnex C contains two examples of calculations of MAWP illustrating the use of the corrosion half-life concept. \n7.6 Required Thickness Determination \nThe required thickness of a pipe shall be the greater of the pressure design thickness or the structural \nminimum thickness. For services with high risk, the piping engineer should consider increasing the required \nthickness to provide for unanticipated or unknown loadings, or undiscovered metal loss. See API 574, \nSection 10, for information on the determination of pressure design thicknesses, structural minimum \nthicknesses, minimum required thicknesses, and minimum alert thicknesses. Table 5 of API 574 provides \nexamples of minimum alert thicknesses and default minimum structural thicknesses for carbon and lowalloy steel piping operating below 400 ¬∞F (205 ¬∞C). \n7.7 Assessment of Inspection Findings \nPressure-containing components found to have damage that could affect their load-carry ing capability \n(pressure loads and other applicable loads, such as weight and wind) shall be evaluated for continued \nservice, or the piping should be removed from service until corrective action/repairs are performed. Fitness-For-Service evaluations, such as those documented in API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, should be used for this \nevaluation for the type of degradation being assessed. \nThe following techniques may be used as applicable. \na)To evaluate metal loss more than the corrosion allowance, a Fitness-For-Service assessment may beperformed in accordance with one of the following parts of API 579-1/ASME FFS-1. This assessmentrequires the use of a future corrosion allowance, which shall be established based on 7.1.\nb)Assessment of general metal loss ‚ÄîAPI 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 4.\nc)Assessment of local metal loss ‚ÄîAPI 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 5.\nd)Assessment of pitting corrosion‚ÄîAPI 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 6.\ne)To evaluate blisters and laminations, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed inaccordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 7. In some cases, this evaluation will require the use ofa future corrosion allowance, which shall be established based on 7.1.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n f) To evaluate weld misalignment and piping distortions, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be \nperformed in accordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 8. \ng) To evaluate crack-like flaws, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed in accordance with \nAPI 579-1/ ASME FFS-1, Part 9. \nh) To evaluate the effects of fire damage, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed in \naccordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 11. \n7.8 Piping Stress Analysis \nPiping shall be supported and guided so that: \na) its weight is carried safely; \nb) it has sufficient flexibility for thermal expansion or contraction; \nc) it does not vibrate excessively; \nd) accounts for other loads ( e.g. those included in the original code of construction). \nPiping flexibility is of increasing concern the larger the diameter of the piping and the greater the difference \nbetween ambient and operating temperature conditions. \nPiping stress analysis to assess system flexibility and support adequacy is not normally performed as part of a piping inspection. However, many existing piping systems were analyzed as part of their original design \nor as part of a rerating or modification, and the results of these analyses can be useful in developing \ninspection plans. When unexpected movement of a piping system is observed, such as during an external visual inspection (see 5.5.5), the inspector should discuss these observations with the pi ping engineer and \nevaluate the need for conducting a piping stress analysis. \nPiping stress analysis can identify the most highly stressed components in a piping system and predict the \nthermal movement of the system when it is placed in operation. This information can be used to concentrate \ninspection efforts at the locations most prone to fatigue damage from thermal expansion (heat up and cool down) cycles and/or creep damage in high-temperature piping. Comparing predicted thermal movements \nwith observed movement can help identify the occurrence of unexpected operating conditions and \ndeterioration of guides and supports. Consultation with the piping engineer may be necessary to explain observed deviations from the analysis predictions, particularly for complicated systems involving multiple supports and guides between end points. \nPiping stress analysis also can be employed to help solve observed piping vibration problems. The natural frequencies in which a piping system will vibrate can be predicted by analysis. The effects of additional \nguiding can be evaluated to assess its abili ty to control vibration by increasing the system ‚Äôs natural \nfrequencies beyond the frequency of exciting forces, such as machine rotational speed. It is important to \ndetermine that guides added to control vibration do not adversely restrict thermal expansion. \n7.9 Reporting and Records for Piping System Inspection \n7.9.1 Records \nPiping system owner-operators shall maintain records of their piping systems and PRDs. Records shall be \nmaintained throughout the service life of each piping system. As a part of these records, inspection and maintenance records shall be regularly updated to include new information pertinent to the operation, \ninspection, and maintenance history of the piping system. See also API 574 for more information of piping \nsystem records. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7.9.2 Types of Piping Records \nPiping system and PRD records shall contain four types of information pertinent to mechanical integrity as \nfollows. \na)Fabrication, construction, and design information to the extent available‚Äîf or example, manufacturer‚Äôsdata report s, material test report s, weld maps, welding procedure specification (WPS)/ procedur equalification record ( PQR), design specification data, piping design calculations, NDE records, heattreat records, PRD sizing calculations, and construction drawings.\nb) Inspection history ‚Äîfor example, inspection reports and data for each type of inspection conducted ( e.g.\ninternal, external, and thickness measurements) and inspection recommendations for repair. Inspectionreports shall document the date of each inspection and/or examination, the date of the next schedul ednspection, the name (or initials) of the person who performed the inspection and/or examination, theserial number or other identifier of the equipment inspected, a description of the inspection and/orexamination performed, and the results of the inspection and/or examination. When data are collectedusing equipment that requires calibration prior, during, or after use, calibration records should be provi dedw\nith the inspection results. Piping RBI records should be in accordance with API 580.\nc)Repair, alteration, and engineering evaluation information‚Äîfor example:\n1)repair and alteration forms if prepared;\n2)reports indicating that piping systems still in-service with either identified deficiencies, temporaryrepairs, or recommendations for repair are suitable for continued service until repairs can becompleted; and\n3)rerating documentation, including rerating calculations and new design conditions.\nd)Fitness-For-Service assessment documentation requirements are described in API 579-1/ASME FFS-1;\nspecific documentation requirements for the type of flaw being assessed are provided in the appropriat ep\nart of API 579-1/ASME FFS-1.\n7.9.3 Operating and Maintenance Records \nSite operating and maintenance records, such as operating conditions, including process upsets that may affect mechanical integrity, changes in-service, and mechanical damage from maintenance, should also be \navailable to the inspector. \n7.9.4 Computer Records \nA computer-based system for storing, calculating, and analyzing data‚Äîan IDMS ‚Äîshould be utilized when \nconsidering the volume of data that will be generated as part of a piping inspection program. The IDMS is useful for the following: \na)storing and analyzing the actual thickness readings;\nb) calculating ST and LT corrosion rates, retirement dates, and minimum required thickness;\nc)highlighting areas of high corrosion rates, piping close to the minimum required thickness, and otherinformation;\nd)inspection planning, including next inspection due dates, intervals, and deferrals;\ne)recommendations for repairs and their due dates;\nf)tracking temporary repairs.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7.9.5 Piping Circuit Records \nThe following information should be recorded for each piping circuit on which CMLs are located: \na)material of construction/piping specification;\nb)piping diameter;\nc)operating and design pressures and temperatures;\nd)ANSI flange rating;\ne)process fluids;\nf)piping classification (if RBI is not being used);\ng)insulation, heat tracing, postweld heat treatment (PWHT);\nh)whether the circuit is a deadleg, injection point, intermittent service, or other special circuit;\ni)the corrosion rate and remaining service life of, at least, the limiting examination point on the circuit;\nj)maximum interval for external inspection;\nk)maximum interval for thickness measurement inspection;\nl)any unusual or localized corrosion mode that would require specialized inspection techniques;\nm) circuit features that might subject it to rapid corrosion increases in the event of a process upset or lossof injection fluid flow.\n7.9.6 ISOs \nThe primary purpose of inspection ISOs is to identify the location of CMLs and to identify the location of \nany recommended maintenance. Inspection ISOs are recommended and should contain the following: \na)all significant components of the piping circuits ( e.g. all valves, elbows, tees, and branches);\nb)material of construction and specification breaks;\nc)all deadlegs, mix points, injection points, and other process connections to the primary piping system;\nd)diameter of piping;\ne)insulated or not;\nf)all secondary piping for Class 1 (or high-consequence RBI) piping circuits;\ng)secondary piping up to the block valve that is normally used for Class 2 (or appropriate RBIconsequence) unit pipe;\nh)all CMLs with appropriate information to locate the CMLs;\ni)adequate orientation and scale to provide legible detail;\nj)piping-circuit numbers and changes;\nk)continuation drawing numbers;\nl)location and type of pipe supports.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nnspection ISOs are recommended for all unit piping and all Class 1 (or high-consequence RBI) piperack \npiping on which CMLs have been identified for thickness measurement. Alternate methods for piperack \npiping that adequately describe the system without ISOs may be used. \nInspection ISOs are recommended for Class 2 (or appropriate RBI consequence) rack piping with CMLs, \nexcept that grid type drawings may be used if all other details are shown. The use of local details or local \nisometrics is acceptable to show the location of CMLs on grid drawings. \nInspection ISOs do not need to be drawn to scale or show dimensions unless necessary to locate CMLs. \n7.9.7 Inspection Reports and Records \nDocumented results (reports and/or records) of the inspection shall be approved by the responsible owner-operator inspector, engineer, or qualified designee. These should be posted into the appropriate IDMS \nwithin 90 days of either the completion of the inspection or the operational start-up of the associated \nequipment. \n7.10 Inspection Recommendations for Repair or Replacement \n7.10.1 General \nA management system for identifying, tracking, and periodically reviewing repair or replacement \nrecommendations (includes recommendations for non-conformances) that impact piping integrity is \nrequired and shall be kept current. The recommendation tracking system shall include the following: \na)recommended corrective action or repair;\nb) due or target date for completion of recommended action;\nc)piping system identifier (e.g. piping system or circuit number) that the recommendation affects;\nd)lists of temporary repairs that may require follow-up monitoring and eventual replacement;\ne) Fitness-For-Service or derating documentation, if necessary;\nf)any required monitoring or mitigation steps;\ng)date recommendation is made;\nh)planned repair date.\n7.10.2 Review of Inspection Repair Recommendations \nInspection repair recommendations can be changed or deleted after review by the inspector or inspection \nsupervisor and optionally by piping engineer. If inspect ion repair recommendations are changed or deleted, \ninspection records shall record the reasoning, date of change/deletion, and name of person who did the \nreview. \n7.11 Inspection Records for External Inspections \nResults of external piping system inspections shall be documented. A combination of checklist and narrative recordkeeping is recommended when documenting inspection results. Checklists should serve the purpose \nof reminding recordkeepers of all the issues important to be included in piping inspection records, but \nnarratives serve the purpose better than checklists for thoroughly documenting inspections results. The \nlocation of CUI inspections, either by insulation removal or NDE, should be identified. The location may be \nidentified by establishing a CML on the appropriate inspection ISO or with marked-up construction ISOs \nand narrative reports. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7.12 Piping Failure and Near-miss Reports \nFailures in piping that occur because of corrosion, cracking, or mechanical damage shall be recorded and \nreported to the owner-operator. Failures in piping systems shall be investigated to identify and correct the \ncause of failure. Near-misses in piping that occur from similar causes as failures should also be reported \nto the owner-operator and appropriately investigated to identify and correct the cause. See API 585 for \nmore information on how to investigate piping incidents ( i.e. failures, near-misses, and unanticipated \ndiscoveries). Temporary repairs to piping systems shall be documented in the inspection records. \n7.13 Deferral of Inspections, Tests, and Examinations \n7.13.1 General \nInspections, tests, or examinations for piping and associated PRDs that cannot be completed by their due \ndate may be deferred for a specified period, subject to the requirements in the following subsections. \nPiping or PRDs that are operated beyond the due date without a valid deferral in accordance with these \nrequirements are not permitted by this code. Deferrals should be the occasional exception, not a frequent \noccurrence. All deferrals shall be documented. Piping or PRDs that were granted a deferral can be operated \nto the new due date without being considered overdue for the deferred inspections, tests, or examinations. \n7.13.2 Simplified Deferral \nA simplified short-term deferral may be approved by the owner-operator if all the following conditions are met. \na)The current due date for the inspection, test, or examination has not been previously deferred.\nb)The proposed new due date would not increase the current inspection/servicing interval or due date bymore than 10 % or 6 months, whichever is less.\nc)A review of the current operating conditions, as well as the piping or PRD history, has been completedwith results that support a short-term/one-time deferral.\nd)The deferral request has the consent of the inspector representing or employed by the owner-operatorand an appropriate operations management representative(s).\ne)Updates to the piping or PRD records with deferral documentation are complete before it is operatedbeyond the original due date.\n7.13.3 Deferral \nDeferral requests not meeting the conditions of a simplified deferral shall follow a documented deferral procedure/pr ocess that includes all the following minimum requirements. \na)Perform a documented risk assessment or update an existing RBI assessment to determine if theproposed deferral date would increase risk above acceptable risk threshold levels as defined by theowner-operator. The risk assessment may include any of the following elements as deemed necessaryby the owner-operator:\n‚Äî fitness for service analysis results;\n‚Äî consequence of failure;\n‚Äî applicable damage mechanism susceptibilities and rates of degradation;\n‚Äî calculated remaining life;\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n‚Äî historical conditions/findings from inspections, tests, and examinations and their technical \nsignificance; \n‚Äî extent and/or probability of detection ( i.e. effectiveness) of previous inspections, tests, or \nexaminations, as well as the amount of time that has elapsed since they were last performed; \n‚Äî considerations for any previous changes to inspection or test intervals ( e.g. reductions in interval \ndue to deteriorating conditions); \n‚Äî disposition(s) of any previous requests for deferral on the same piping or PRD; \n‚Äî historical conditions/findings for piping or PRDs in similar service, if available. \nb)Determine if the deferral requires the implementation of or modification to existing IOWs or operatingprocess control limits.\nc)Review the current inspection plan to determine if modifications are needed to support the deferral.\nd)Obtain the consent and approval of appropriate piping personnel, including the inspector representi ngor employed by the owner-operator and appropriate operations management representative(s).\ne)Updates to the piping or PRD records with deferral documentation are complete before it is operatedbeyond the original due date.\n7.14 Deferral of Inspection Repair Recommendation Due Dates \nThe deferral of inspection recommendations should be the occasional exception not a frequent occurrence. \nInspection and repair recommendations that cannot be completed by their due date can be deferred for a \nspecific period. The deferral, including the justification of the due date and approval of the deferral by \nappropriate site personnel, shall be documented in the inspection records. At a minimum, this shall include \nthe inspector and inspection supervisor; however, the owner-operator should include the appropriate site \nmanagement representative when the authority to accept higher-than-normal operating risk is required. \nInspection recommendations that have not been completed by the required due date without a documented and approved deferral are considered overdue for completion. Piping and piping components shall remain \nat or above the minimum required thickness during the deferral period. The minimum required thickness \ncan be determined using methods defined in 7.6. \n8 Repairs, Alterations, and Rerating of Piping Systems \n8.1 Repairs and Alterations \n8.1.1 General \nThe principles of ASME B31.3 or the code to which the piping system was built shall be followed to the extent \npractical for in-service repairs. ASME B31.3 is written for design and construction of piping systems. However, \nmost of the technical requirements on design, welding, examination, and materials also can be applied in the \ninspection, rerating, repair, and alteration of operating piping systems. When ASME B31.3 cannot be followed \nbecause of its new construction coverage (such as revised or new material specifications, inspection \nrequirement s, certain heat treatments, and pressure tests), the piping engineer or inspector shall be guided by \nThe principles and practices of API 577 shall also be followed for all welded repairs and modifications. \nIf any of the restorative changes of a repair result in a change of design temperature or pressure, the requirements for rerating also shall be satisfied. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n8.1.2 Authorization \nAll repair and alteration work shall be done by a repair organization as defined in 4.3. 2 and shall be \nauthorized by the inspector prior to its commencement. Authorization for alteration work to a piping system \nmay not be given without prior consultation with, and approval by, the piping engineer. The inspector will \ndesignate any inspection hold points required during the repair or alteration sequence. The inspector may \ngive prior general authorization for limited or routine repairs and procedures, provided the inspector is \nsatisfied with the competency of the repair organization. \n8.1.3 Approval \nAll proposed methods of design, execution, materials, welding procedures, examination, and testing shall \nbe approved by the inspector or by the piping engineer, as appropriate. Owner-operator approval of on-stream welding is required. \nWelding repairs of cracks that occurred in-service should not be attempted without prior consultation with \nthe piping engineer to identify and correct the cause of the cracking. Examples are cracks suspected of \nbeing caused by vibration, thermal cycling, thermal expansion problems, and environmental cracking. \nThe inspector shall approve all repair and alteration work at designated hold points and after the repairs and\n8.1.4 Welding Repairs (Including On-stream) \n8.1.4.1 Temporary Repairs \nFor temporary repairs, including on-stream, a full encirclement welded split sleeve or box-type enclosure \ndesigned by the piping engineer may be applied over the damaged or corroded area. See various articles in ASME PCC-2 for more information on repairs to piping systems. Longitudinal cracks shall not be repaired \nin this manner unless the piping engineer has determined that cracks would not be expected to propagate from under the sleeve. The design of temporary enclosures and repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer. \nIf the repair area is localized (for example, pitting or pinholes) and the SMYS of the pipe is not more than 40,000 psi (275,800 kPa), and a Fitness-For-Service analysis shows that it is acceptable, a temporary \nrepair may be made by fillet welding a properly designed split coupling or plate patch over the pitted or \nlocally thinned area. The material for the repair shall match the base metal unless approved by the piping \nengineer. A f illet-welded patch shall not be installed on top of an existing fillet-welded patch. When installing \na fillet-welded patch adjacent to an existing fillet-welded patch, the minimum distance between the toe of \nthe fillet weld shall not be less than: \n4d Rt=\nwhere \nd is the minimum distance between the toes of fillet welds of adjacent fillet weld attachments, in \ninches (millimeters); \nR is the inside radius in inches (millimeters); \nt is the minimum required thickness of the fillet-welded patch in inches (millimeters). \nFor minor leaks and thinning below tmin, properly designed enclosures may be welded over the leak or thin \npiping while the piping system is in-service, provided the inspector is satisfied that adequate thickness \nremains in the actual location of the proposed weld and heat-affected zone, and the piping component can \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n withstand welding without the likelihood of further material damage, such as from caustic service. Any leak in \na Class 1 service, or where a risk ranking is determined to be high, shall be first reviewed by a piping \nengineer to determine if the work can be safely performed while the system remains on stream. \nTemporary repairs should be removed and replaced with a suitable permanent repair at the next available \nmaintenance opportunity. Temporary repairs may remain in place for a longer period only if approved and \ndocumented by the piping engineer. \n8.1.4.2 Permanent Repairs \nRepairs to defects found in piping components may be made by preparing a welding groove that completely \nremoves the defect and then filling the groove with weld metal deposited in accordance with 8.2. \nCorroded areas may be restored with weld metal deposited in accordance with 8.2. Surface irregularities \nand contamination shall be removed before welding. Appropriate NDE methods shall be applied after \ncompletion of the weld. \nIf it is feasible to take the piping system out of service, the defective area may be removed by cutting out a \ncylindrical section and replacing it with a piping component that meets the applicable code. \nInsert patches (flush patches) may be used to repair damaged or corroded areas if the following \nrequirements are met: \na) full-penetration groove welds are provided; \nb) for Class 1 and Class 2 piping systems, the welds shall be 100 % radiographed or ultrasonically tested \nusing NDE procedures that are approved by the inspector; \nc) patches may be any shape but shall have rounded corners [1 in. (25 mm) minimum radius]. See ASME \nPCC-2 for more information on various welded repairs to piping systems. \n8.1.5 Nonwe lded Repairs (On-stream) \nTemporary repairs of locally thinned sections or circumferential linear defects may be made on-stream by \ninstalling a properly designed and applied enclosure ( e.g. bolted clamp, nonmetallic composite wrap, \nmetallic and epoxy wraps, or another nonwelded applied temporary repair). The design shall include control \nof axial thrust loads if the piping component being enclosed is (or may become) insufficient to control \npressure thrust. The effect of enclosing (crushing) forces on the component also shall be considered. See \nASME PCC-2 for more information on nonmetallic composite wrap repair methods. \nDuring turnarounds or other appropriate opportunities, temporary leak sealing and leak dissipating devices, \n(e.g. wire wrapping, mechanical clamps, etc.), including temporary repairs on valves, shall be removed and \nappropriate actions taken to restore the original integrity of the piping system. The inspector and/or piping \nengineer shall be involved in determining repair methods and procedures. Temporary leak sealing and leak \ndissipating devices may remain in place for a longer period only if approved and documented by the piping \nengineer. From a mechanical integrity perspective, injection fittings on valves to seal fugitive (LDAR) \nemissions from valve stem seal are not considered to be temporary repairs. Their removal or valve \nreplacement is at the discretion of the owner operator. \nProcedures that include leak sealing fluids (‚Äúpumping‚Äù) for process piping should be reviewed for acceptance by the\n inspector or piping engineer. The review should take into consideration the compatibility \nof the sealant with the leaking material; the pumping pressure on the clamp, especially when repumping, \nand any resulting crushing forces; the risk of sealant affecting downstream flow meters, PRDs, or \nmachinery; the risk of subsequent leakage at bolt threads causing corrosion or stress corrosion cracking of \nbolts; and the number of times the seal area is repumped. \nSee ASME PCC-2 for more information on nonwelded repairs for piping systems. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n 8.2 Welding and Hot Tapping \n8.2.1 General \nAll repair and alteration welding shall be done in accordance with the principles of ASME B31.3 or the code \nto which the piping system was built. \nAny welding conducted on piping components in operation shall be done in accordance with API 2201. The \ninspector shall use as a minimum the ‚ÄúSuggested Hot Tap Checklist‚Äù contained in API 2201 for hot tapping \nperformed on piping components. See API 577 for further guidance on hot tapping and welding in-service. \n8.2.2 Procedures, Qualifications, and Records \nThe repair organization shall use welders and welding procedures qualified in accordance with ASME B31.3 \nor the code to which the piping was built. See API 577 for guidance on welding procedures and \nqualifications. \nThe repair organization shall maintain records of welding procedures and welder performance \nqualifications. These records shall be available to the inspector prior to the start of welding. \n8.2.3 Preheating and PWHT \n8.2.3.1 General \nRefer to API 577 for guidance on preheating and PWHT. \n8.2.3.2 Preheating \nPreheat temperatures used in making welding repairs shall be in accordance with the applicable code and \nqualified welding procedure. Exceptions for temporary repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer. \nNOTE Preheating alone may not be considered as an alternative to environmental cracking prevention. \nPiping systems constructed of steels initially requiring PWHT normally are postweld heat treated if alterations or\n repairs involving pressure-retaining welding are performed. \n8.2.3.3 PWHT \nPWHT of piping system repairs or alterations should be made using the applicable requirements of ASME \nB31.3 or the code to which the piping was built. See 8.2.4 for an alternative preheat procedure for some \nPWHT requirements. Exceptions for temporary repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer and be in \naccordance with ASME PCC-2. \nLocal PWHT may be substituted for 360¬∞ banding on local repairs on all materials, provided the following \nprecautions and requirements are applied. \na) The application is reviewed, and a procedure is developed by the piping engineer. \nb) In evaluating the suitability of a procedure, consideration shall be given to applicable factors, such as \nbase metal thickness, thermal gradients, material properties, changes resulting from PWHT, the need \nfor full-penetration welds, and surface and volumetric examinations after PWHT. Additionally, the \noverall and local strains and distortions resulting from the heating of a local restrained area of the piping \nwall shall be considered in developing and evaluating PWHT procedures. \nc) A preheat of 300 ¬∞F (150 ¬∞C), or higher as specified by specific welding procedures, is maintained while \nwelding. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nd)The required PWHT temperature shall be maintained for a distance of not less than two times the basemetal thickness measured from the weld. The PWHT temperature shall be monitored by a suitabl enumber of thermocouples (a minimum of two) based on the size and shape of the area being heat treated.\ne)Controlled heat also shall be applied to any branch connection or other attachment within the PWHTarea.\nf)The PWHT is performed for code compliance and not for environmental cracking resistance.\n8.2.4 Preheat or Controlled Deposition Welding Methods as Alternatives to PWHT \n8.2.4.1 General \nIn some instances, full PWHT may have potential adverse effects on equipment and piping. Nevertheless, the piping\n may have been originally postweld heat treat ed or may require PWHT according to the original \nconstruction code. In these cases, preheat and controlled deposition welding may be used in lieu of PWHT, \nas described in 8.2.4.2 and 8.2.4.3. However, prior to using alternative methods, a piping engineer shall \nensure that the alternative is suitable based on a metallurgical review. The review shall consider factors \nsuch as the reason for the original PWHT, susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking, stresses in the location \nof the weld, susceptibility to high temperature hydrogen attack, susceptibility to creep, etc. \nThe welding method shall be selected based on the rules according to the applicable code /standard. I n \naddition, the adequacy of the as-welded joint at operating and pressure test conditions should be \nconsidered. \nWhen reference is made in this section to materials by the ASME designations, P-numbers and Group \nnumbers, the requirements of this section apply to the applicable materials of the original code of \nconstruction, either ASME or other, which conform by chemical composition and mechanical properties to \nthe ASME P-number and Group number designations. \nPressure boundary process piping alterations or repair welds that initially required PWHT shall be postweld heat\n treated, with the exceptions listed in 8.2.4.2 and 8.2.4.3. If valid for the current rated design, the original \njoint efficiency factor may be used when alternative PWHTs are practiced. \n8.2.4.2 Preheating Method (Notch Toughness Testing Not Required) \nThe preheating method, when performed in lieu of PWHT, is limited to the following materials and weld processes. \na)The materials shall be limited to P-No. 1, Group 1, 2, and 3, and to P-No. 3, Group 1 and 2 (excluding\nMn-Mo steels in Group 2).\nb)The welding shall be limited to the shielded metal arc welding, gas metal arc welding, gas tungsten arcwelding, and flux-cored arc welding processes.\nThe welders and welding procedures shall be qualified in accordance with the applicable rules of the original code of\n construction, except that the PWHT of the test coupon used to qualify the procedure shall be omitted. \nThe weld area shall be preheated and maintained at a minimum temperature of 300¬∞F (150 ¬∞C) during \nwelding. The 300 ¬∞F (150 ¬∞C) temperature should be checked to ensure that 4 in. (100 mm) of the material \nor four times the material thickness (whichever is greater) on each side of the groove is maintained at the \nminimum temperature during welding. The maximum interpass temperature shall not exceed 600 ¬∞F (315 ¬∞C). \nWhen the weld does not penetrate through the full thickness of the material, the minimum preheat and \nmaximum interpass temperatures need only be maintained at 4 in. (100 mm) or four times the depth of the \nrepair weld, whichever is greater on each side of the joint. \nThe use of the preheat alternative requires consultation with the piping engineer who should consider the potential for\n environmental cracking and whether the welding procedure will provide adequate toughness. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n Examples of situations where this alternative could be considered include seal welds, weld metal buildup \nof thin areas, and welding support clips. \nNOTE Notch toughness testing is not required when using this preheat method in lieu of PWHT. \n8.2.4.3 Controlled-deposition Welding Method (Notch Toughness Testing Required) \nThe controlled-deposition welding method may be used in lieu of PWHT in accordance wit h the following. \na) Notch toughness testing, such as that established by ASME B31.1‚Äî Chapter III, Section 323, is \nnecessary when impact tests are required by the original code of construction or the construction code \napplicable to the work planned. \nb) The materials shall be limited to P-No. 1, P-No. 3, and P-No. 4 steels. \nc) The welding shall be limited to the shielded metal arc welding, gas metal arc welding, flux-cored arc \nwelding, and gas tungsten arc welding processes. \nd) A weld procedure specification shall be developed and qualified for each application. The welding \nprocedure shall define the preheat temperature and interpass temperature and include the postheating \ntemperature requirement in item f) 8). The qualification thickness for the test plates and repair grooves \nshall be in accordance with Table 3. The test material for the welding procedure qualification shall be \nof the same material specification (including specification type, grade, class, and condition of heat \ntreatment) as the original material specification for the repair. If the original material specification is \nobsolete, the test material used should conform as much as possible to the material used for \nconstruction, but in no case shall the material be lower in strength or have a carbon content of more \nthan 0.35 %. \ne) When impact tests are required by the construction code applicable to the work planned, the PQR shall \ninclude sufficient tests to determine if the toughness of the weld metal and the heat-affected zone of \nthe base metal in the as-welded condition is adequate at the MDMT (such as the criteria used in ASME \nB31.3). If special hardness limits are necessary (for example, as set forth in NACE SP0472 and NACE \nMR0103) for corrosion resistance, the PQR shall include hardness tests as well. \nf) The WPS shall include the following add itional requirements. \n1) The supplementary essential variables of ASME BPVC, Section IX, paragraph QW-250, shall apply. \n2) The maximum weld heat input for each layer shall not exceed that used in the procedure \nqualification test. \n3) The minimum preheat temperature for welding shall not be less than that used in the procedure qualification\n test. \n4) The maximum interpass temperature for welding shall not be greater than that used in the \nprocedure qualification test. \n5) The preheat temperature shall be checked to en sure that 4 in. (100 mm) of the material or four \ntimes the material thickness (whichever is greater) on each side of the weld joint will be maintained \nat the minimum temperature during welding. When the weld does not penetrate through the full \nthickness of the material, the minimum preheat temperature need only be maintained at 4 in. (100 \nmm) or four times the depth of the repair weld, whichever is greater on each side of the joint. \n6) For the allowed welding processes in item c), use only electrodes and filler metals that are classified \nby the filler metal specification with an optional supplemental diffusible-hydrogen designator of H8 \nor lower. When shielding gases are used with a process, the gas shall exhibit a dew point that is \nnot higher than ‚Äì60 ¬∞F ( ‚Äì50 ¬∞C). Surfaces on which welding will be done shall be maintained in a \ndry condition during welding and free of rust, mill scale, and hydrogen-producing contaminants, \nsuch as oil, grease, and other organic materials. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n7)The welding technique shall be a controlled-deposition, temper-bead, or half-bead technique. Thespecific technique shall be used in the procedure qualification test.\n8)For welds made by shielded metal arc welding, once filling is completed, do not allow the weldmentto cool below the minimum preheat temperature. In addition, raise the weldment temperature t o\n500 \n¬∞F ¬± 50 ¬∞F (260 ¬∞C ¬± 30 ¬∞C) for a minimum period of 2 hours. This assists outgassing diffusionof any weld metal hydrogen picked up during welding. This hydrogen bake-out may be omitt edw\nhen H4 filler metal (such as E7018-H4) is specified.\n9)After the finished repair weld has cooled to ambient temperature, the final temper beadreinforcement layer shall be removed substantially flush with the surface of the base material.\nRefer to WRC 412 for additional supporting technical information regarding controlled deposition welding. \nTable 3‚Äî Welding Methods as Alternatives to PWHT Qualification Thickness for Test Plates and \nRepair Grooves \nDepth t of Test Groove \nWelded a Repair Groove Depth \nQualified Thickness T of Test \nCoupon Welded Thickness Base Metal \nQualified \nt < t < 2 in.

The design of temporary enclosures and repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer. \nNew connections may be installed on piping systems provided the design, location, and method of \nattachment conform to the principles of the applicable code. \nFillet-welded patches require special design considerations, especially relating to weld-joint efficiency and \ncrevice corrosion. Fillet-welded patches shall be designed by the piping engineer. A patch may be applied \nto the external surfaces of piping, provided it is in accordance with 8.1. 4.1 and meets either of the following \nrequirements: \na)the proposed patch provides design strength equivalent to a reinforced opening designed according tothe\n applicable code;\nb)the proposed patch is designed to absorb the membrane strain of the part in a manner that is i naccordance with the principles of the applicable code, if the following criteria are met:\n1)the allowable membrane stress is not exceeded in the piping part or the patch;\n2)the strain in the patch does not result in fillet weld stresses exceeding allowable stresses for suchwelds;\n3)an overlay patch shall have rounded corners.\nDifferent components in the same piping system or circuit may have different design temperatures. In establishing the\n design temperature, consideration shall be given to process fluid temperatures, ambient \ntemperatures, heating and cooling media temperatures, and insulation. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris",

The owner-operator may confirm inspection \ntargets with operational history or other documentation. \nPiping systems that are known to have a remaining life of over 10 years or that are adequately protected \nagainst external corrosion need not be included for the NDE inspection recommended in Table 2. However, \nthe condition of the insulating system or the outer jacketing, such as a cold-box shell, should be observed \nperiodically by operating or other personnel. If deterioration is noted, it should be reported to the inspector. \nThe following are examples of these systems: \na)piping systems insulated effectively to preclude the entrance of moisture;\nb)jacketed cryogenic piping systems;\nc)piping systems installed in a cold box in which the atmosphere is purged with an inert gas;\nd)piping systems in which the temperature being maintained is sufficiently low or sufficiently high topreclude the presence of water.\nThe external visual inspection on bare piping is to assess the condition of paint and coating systems, to check for\n external corrosion, and to check for other forms of deterioration. \n6.5 Extent of Thickness Measurement Inspection and Data Analysis \n6.5.1 CML Monitoring \nTo satisfy inspection interval requirements, each thickness measurement inspection should obtain thickness \nreadings on a representative sampling of the total number of CMLs on each circuit (see 5.6). It is not the intent \nof this code that every established CML needs to be measured each time. A statistical sampling of active \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nMLs is an acceptable approach, for a circuit-based analysis per the provisions outlined in 6.5.3. In addition, \nsome CMLs may be documented as inactive and therefore do not need to be measured and would not be \nconsidered overdue. This representative sampling should include data for all the various types of components \nand orientations (horizontal and vertical) found in each circuit. This sampling also shall include CMLs with the \nearliest renewal date as of the previous inspection. Where general thinning is predicted, this sampling should \ninclude all the various types of components within the circuit. Where localized damage mechanisms are \nidentified, sampling should also include the location and orientation (top/bottom, inside/outside radius, etc.) \nwhere the damage is most likely to occur. The number and specific CMLs to be monitored at each inspection \nshall be determined by the inspector in consultation with a piping engineer and/or corrosion specialist where \nnonuniform corrosion or other damage mechanisms are expected. Therefore, scheduled inspection of circuits \nshould obtain as many measurements as necessary to satisfactorily monitor the type and extent of damage \nanticipated in each piping system. If RBI is used to set the inspection interval or due date, CMLs not required \nfor inspection per the RBI assessment do not need to be inspected in accordance with the recommended \nmaximum inspection intervals in Table 1. \nTo determine the extent of thickness measurements necessary to develop a corrosion rate and remaining \nlife, two basic approaches are acceptable as discussed below. \n6.5.2 Point-to-Point Method \nThis analysis method is where the corrosion rate, remaining life, and reinspection interval are determined \nfor each individual CML without adjustment for the results of other CML measurements in the circuit. Future \ninspections are managed based on the 1/2 life established at each CML location. During a reinspection of a \npiping system, all the CMLs may be reinspected or only those that are coming due. This method can lead \nto frequent inspections of the same piping system if not carefully managed. It is generally not possible to apply \na statistical analysis with the point-to-point method since 1) a relationship of one CML to another has not been \nestablished, making it difficult to compare corrosion rates in the circuit or between CMLs, and 2) the individual \nCML rates may be generated over significantly different time periods, when operating conditions may have \nchanged. \n6.5.3 Circuit Analysis Method \nWhere piping has been circuitized into common corrosion mechanisms and expected rates, a statistical analysis \nmay be used to determine the appropriate number of representative sample points, a representative circuit \ncorrosion rate, and the inspection interval. There are a number of considerations for using a statistical analysis \napproach that are necessary to remain appropriately conservative, some of which include the following. \na)Approach is generally applicable to damage mechanisms that produce uniform corrosion. However,\nwhen considering localized corrosion, the approach must be constructed for proper application.\nb)Locations that exhibit significantly different corrosion rates and locations with shorter remaining life mayneed to\n be analyzed separately and/or moved to separate circuits.\nc)A sampling statistic should be considered to check the statistical confidence factor given the variabilityof the data\n set (within a circuit).\nd)The number of data points (CMLs) may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired statistical confidencebefore\n employing a statistical methodology.\ne)A safety factor or confidence interval, which may be dependent on the expected damage mechanismsand may additionally account for circuit complexity, should be considered to account for uncertaintiessuch as measurement error and overall failure risk.\nf)CML reinspection shall not be extended beyond the date projected to reach the established minimumrequired thickness. Absolute limits should be considered for reinspection of CMLs based on thelikelihood of failure (e.g. time or thickness limit).\ng)Depending on the statistical analysis method used, the data population should be tested to make sur et meets the criteria for the distribution type utilized in the analysis.\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nAs a minimum, the worst-case CMLs (those that are driving the need for the next inspection (e.g. those \nwith the highest corrosion rate and/or the lowest remaining corrosion allowance) within the circuit shall be \ninspected at the next established inspection interval. \n6.5.4 Data Analysis \nSome level of data analysis is recommended under both approaches discussed above. Since the calculated \ncorrosion rate used to predict the future remaining life was a product of the prior operating history, it is \nimportant to check for any acceleration of the corrosion rate over time and to be aware of planned \noperational changes. Good quality MOC and IOW programs are beneficial where critical process variables \nthat may affect corrosion/dam\nSin√≥nimos ES: CUI; extensi√≥n de inspecci√≥n; muestreo; corrosi√≥n bajo aislamiento\nSynonyms EN: recommended extent of cui inspection following visual inspection for susceptible piping api 570; piping inspection; recommended extent of cui inspection following visual inspection for susceptible piping 4"

Users have experienced brittle fracture of steel components \nduring new construction, repairs, and alterations to existing systems. Some of the materials involved \nincluded those produced to A105, A106, and A234 WPB spec ifications. Current ASTM specifications \nexempt many of these standard materials from toughness testing down to ‚àí20 ¬∞F. Increased risk may occur \nand be experienced in services that involve hydrotesting, operational temperatures down to ‚àí20 ¬∞ F, \nautorefrigeration, and depressurizing of systems involving LHC. Users are advised to evaluate the literature \n(see Bibliography) to be aware of this issue in case repairs, replacements, or modifications might be at risk \ndue to these low-toughness fittings. \n8.2.7 NDE \nAcceptance of a welded repair or alteration shall include NDE in accordance with the applicable code and \nAPI 577 shall also be\n followed. When surface and volumetric examinations are required, they shall be in \naccordance with ASME BPVC, Section V (or equivalent). \n8.2.8 Pressure Testing \nAfter welding is completed, a pressure test in accordance with 5.11 shall be performed if practical and \ndeemed necessary by the inspector. Pressure tests are normally required after alterations and major \nrepairs. See ASME PCC-2, Article 5.1, for more information on conducting pressure tests. When a pressure \ntest is not necessary or practical, NDE shall be utilized in lieu of a pressure test. Substituting appropriate \nNDE procedures for a pressure test after an alteration, rerating, or repair may be done only after \nconsultation with the inspector and the piping engineer. For existing insulated lines that are being pre ssure \ntested after repairs, rerating, or alterations, it is not necessary to strip insulation on all existing welds. \nPressure tests with longer hold times and observations of pressure gauges can be substituted for insulation \nstripping when the risks associated with leak under the insulation are acceptable. \nWhen it is not practical to perform a pressure test of a final closure weld that joins a new or replacement section of\n piping to an existing system, all the following requirements shall be satisfied. \na)The new or replacement piping section is pressure tested and examined in accordance with t heapplicable code governing the design of the piping system, or if not practical, welds are examined withappropriate NDE, as specified by the authorized piping inspector.\nb)The closure weld is a weld between any pipe or standard piping component of equal diameter a ndt\nhickness, axially aligned (not miter cut), and of equivalent materials.

An inspection plan designed to address the unique challenges of these piping \nsections is required, and guidance can be found in API 574. \nThe inspection plans shall be based on an assessment of the effectiveness of protection systems and data \nobtained from one or more of the following methods: \na)an assessment of the performance of protection methods such as external coatings and cathodicprotection;\nb) above-ground visual surveillance results (see API 574);\nc)observations during maintenance activity on connecting piping of similar materials;\nd)representative portions of the actual piping;\ne)buried piping in similar service including burial conditions;\nf)permanently installed thickness monitoring devices;\ng)inspections conducted with in-line inspection devices;\nh)results of inspections above the pipe (e.g. direct current voltage gradient), local exposed areas\n(thickness surveys), or extended range (long-range UT) that provides data on condition and integrity\n(see API 574).\n9.2 Frequency and Extent of Inspection \n9.2.1 Above-grade V isual Surveillance \nThe owner-operator should, at approximately 6-month intervals, survey the surface conditions on and \nadjacent to each buried piping path (see API 574 for additional guidance on how to perform these actions). \n9.2.2 Pipe-to-Soil Potential Survey \nA close-interval potential survey on a line with cathodic protection may be used to verify that the buried \npiping has an acceptable protective potential throughout its length. For poorly coated pipes where cathodic \nprotection potentials are inconsistent, the survey may be conducted at 3-to-5-year intervals for verification \nof continuous corrosion control. \nFor piping with no cathodic protection or in areas where leaks have occurred due to external corrosion, a pipe-to-soil potential survey may be conducted along the pipe route. The pipe should be excavated for \ninspection or inspected with appropriate NDE at sites where possibilities of active corrosion cells have been located to determine the extent of corrosion damage. A continuous potential profile or a close-interval survey may be required to better locate active corrosion cells. See API 574 for additional guidance on how \nto perform these actions. \n9.2.3 Pipe Coating Holiday Survey \nThe frequency of pipe coating holiday surveys is usually based on indications that other forms of corrosion \ncontrol are ineffective. For example, on a coated pipe where there is gradual loss of cathodic protection \npotentials or an external corrosion leak occurs at a coating defect, a pipe coating holiday survey may be used to evaluate the coating. See API 574 for additional guidance on when and how to perform these \nactions. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\n \n 9.2.4 Soil Corrosivity \nFor piping buried in lengths greater than 100 ft (30 m) and not cathodically protected, evaluations of soil \ncorrosivity should be performed at appropriate intervals based on likelihood of change. Soil resistivity measurements may be used for relative class ification of the soil corrosivity (see 9.5). Additional factors that \nmay warrant consideration are changes in soil chemistry and analyses of the polarization resistance of the soil and piping interface. See API 574 for guidance on how to perform these acti ons. \n9.2.5 External and Internal Inspection Intervals \nIf internal corrosion of buried piping is expected because of inspection on the above-grade portion of the \nline, inspection intervals and methods for the buried portion should be adjusted accordingly. The inspector should be aware of and consider the possibility of accelerated internal corrosion in deadlegs. \nThe external condition of buried piping that is not cathodically protected should be determined by either inline inspection, which can measure wall thickness, or by excavating according to the frequency given in \nTable 4. Significant external corrosion detected by in-line inspection or by other means may require \nexcavation and evaluation even if the piping is cathodically protected. \nPiping inspected periodically by excavation shall be inspected in lengths of 6 ft to 8 ft (2.0 m to 2.5 m) at \none or more locations judged to be most susceptible to corrosion. Excavated piping should be inspected \nfull circumference for the type and extent of corrosion (pitting or general) and the condition of the coating. \nIf inspection reveals damaged coating or corroded piping, additional piping shall be excavated until the \nextent of the condition is identified. If the average wall thickness is at or below the minimum required \nthickness, it shall be repaired or replaced. \nIf the piping is contained inside a casing pipe, the condition of the casing should be inspected to determine if water and/or soil has entered the casing. The inspector should verify the following: \na) both ends of the casing extend beyond the soil surface; \nb) the ends of the casing are sealed if the casing is not self-draining; \nc) the pressure-carrying pipe is properly coated and wrapped; \nd) there is no metallic or electrolytic contact between the casing and the pressure carrying pipe. \n9.2.6 Leak Testing Intervals \nAn alternative or supplement to inspection is leak testing with liquid at a pressure at least 10 % greater than maximum operating pressure at intervals one-half the length of those shown in Table 4 for piping not \ncathodically protected and at the same intervals as shown in Table 4 for cathodically protected piping. The \nleak test should be maintained for a period of 8 hours. Four hours after the initial pressurization of the piping \nsystem, the pressure should be noted and, if necessary, the line repressurized to original test pressure and \nisolated from the pressure source. If, during the remainder of the test period, the pressure decreases more \nthan 5 %, the piping should be visually inspected externally and/or inspected internally to find the leak and assess the extent of corrosion. Sonic measurements may be helpful in locating leaks during leak testing. \nBuried piping also may be surveyed for integrity by using temperature-corrected volumetric or pressure test \nmethods. Other alternative leak test methods involve acoustic emission examination and the addition of a tracer fluid to the pressurized line (such as helium or sulfur hexafluoride). If the tracer is added to the service \nfluid, the owner-operator shall confirm suitability for process and product. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris\n\nTable 4‚ÄîFrequency of Inspection or Alternate Leak Testing for Buried Piping without Effective \nCathodic Protection \nSoil Resistivity \n(ohm-cm) Inspection Interval \n(years) Alternate Pressure Test \nInterval with Effective \nCathodic Protection \n(years) Alternate Pressure Test \nInterval without Effective \nCathodic Protection \n(years) \n< 2000 5 5 2.5 \n2000‚Äì 10,000 10 10 5 \n> 10,000 15 15 7.5 \n9.3 Repairs to Buried Piping Systems \n9.3.1 Repairs to Coatings \nAny coating removed for inspection shall be renewed and inspected appropriately (preferably by a NACE \ncertified coating inspector). For coating repairs, the inspector should be assured that the coating meets the \nfollowing criteria: \na)it has sufficient adhesion to the pipe to prevent under-film migration of moisture;\nb)it is sufficiently ductile to resist cracking;\nc)it is free of voids and gaps in the coating (holidays);\nd)it has sufficient strength to resist damage due to handling and soil stress;\ne)it can support any supplemental cathodic protection.\nIn addition, coating repairs may be tested using a high-voltage holiday detector. The detector voltage shall \nbe adjusted to the appropriate value for the coating material and thickness. Any holidays found shall be \nrepaired and retested. \n9.3.2 Clamp Repairs \nIn general, bolted clamps should be avoided for temporary repairs to all buried piping. If piping leaks are clamped and reburied, the location of the clamp shall be logged in the inspection record and may be surface marked. Both the marker and the record shall note the date of installation and the location of the clamp. All \nclamps shall be considered temporary. Temporary repairs on buried piping should be permanently repaired \nat the next maintenance opportunity unless approved for extension by a piping engi neer. \n9.3.3 Welded Repairs \nWelded repairs shall be made in accordance with 8.2. \n9.4 Records \nRecord systems for buried piping should be maintained in accordance with 7.9. In addition, a record of the \nlocation and date of installation of temporary clamps shall be maintained. Also, buried piping should be \nlocated on a drawing (i.e. plot plan or piping iso) indicating size and external corrosion mitigation. \nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from Accuris",
